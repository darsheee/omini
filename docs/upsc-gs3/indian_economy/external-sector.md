## Balance of Payments

#### 

:::details Current Account
- It refers to the account maintained by every government of the world in which every kind of current transactions is shown—basically this account is maintained by the central banking body of the economy on behalf of the government. 
- Current transactions of an economy in foreign currency all over the world are—export, import, interest payments, private remittances and transfers. 
- All transactions are shown as either inflow or outflow (credit or debit).
-  At the end of the year, the current account might be positive or negative. 
-  The positive one is known as a surplus current account, and the negative one is known as a deficit current account. 
-  As per the Economic Survey 2019–20, the current account deficit (CAD) of India was 
-   Lower Current Account Deficit reflects reduced external indebtedness of the country making domestic economic policy increasingly independent of external influence.

####  
:::details Capital Account

- Every government of the world maintains a capital account, which shows the capital kind of transactions of the economy with outside economies. 
- Every transaction in foreign currency (inflow or outflow) considered as capital is shown in this account—external lending and borrowing, foreign currency deposits of banks, external bonds issued by the Government of India, FDI, PIS and security market investment of the QFIs (Rupee is fully convertible in this case). 
- There is no deficit or surplus in this account like the current account.

:::details Balance of Payments and Invisibles
- The outcome of the total transactions of an economy with the outside world in one year is known as the balance of payment (BoP) of the economy.
-  Basically, it is the net outcome of the current and capital accounts of an economy. 
-  It might be favourable or unfavourable for the economy. 
- A negative BoP is unfavourable for an economy if only the economy lacks the means to fill the gap of negativity.
- If there is a positive Balance of Payment (BOP) at the end of the year, the money is automatically transferred to the foreign exchange reserves of the economy.
-  And if there is any negative outcome, the same foreign exchange is drawn from the country’s forex reserves. 
-  If the forex reserves are not capable of fulfilling the negativity created by the BoP, it is known as a BoP crisis and the economy tries different means to solve the crisis in which going for forex help from the IMF is the last resort.

##  Currency Convertibility
:::details Definition of  Currency Convertibility
- An economy may permit full or partial convertibility of its currency in the current and capital accounts.
- Full current account convertibility occurs when domestic currency can be converted into foreign currency for all current account purposes.
- Full capital account convertibility occurs when domestic currency can be converted into foreign currency for capital outflow.
- In cases of partial convertibility, only the portion approved by the government can be converted into foreign currency for current and capital purposes.
- It is crucial to remember that currency convertibility pertains only to foreign currency outflow.

:::



#### 
:::details What does Rupee Convertibility mean?
- India has historically had limited foreign exchange earning capacity, leading to stringent measures to control foreign exchange outflow for both current and capital purposes.
- However, economic reforms have significantly altered this situation.

:::


####
:::details Convertibility of Current Account
- The current account is now fully convertible.
- This means that the entire amount of foreign exchange needed for current purposes is made available at the official exchange rate, allowing unrestricted outflow of foreign exchange.

:::


####
:::details Convertibility of Capital Account
- Following the recommendations of the S.S. Tarapore Committee (1997) on Capital Account Convertibility, India has been gradually moving towards full convertibility in the Capital Account, albeit with necessary precautions.
- Despite being a country of partial convertibility (40:60) in the capital account, India has implemented substantial reforms, allowing full capital account convertibility up to certain levels of foreign exchange requirements.

## Different Currency Regime

#### 
:::details Foreign Currency Exchange Market
- The market where different currencies can be bought and sold is called the foreign exchange market.
-  Out of the trades in different currencies, the exchange rate of the currency is determined by the economy.0 This is an institutional framework for the exchange of one national currency for another.11 This is particularly correct either in the case of a free float exchange (i.e., floating currency) regime or is a managed or hybrid exchange rate system. It is altogether not allowed either in a fixed currency system or a hard fix (in a hard fix this happens once the currency to which the hard fix has been done itself starts fluctuating).

:::


#### 
:::details Fixed Currency Regime
- The fixed currency regime4 is a method of regulating exchange rates of world currencies brought by the IMF. In this system exchange rate of a particular currency was fixed by the IMF keeping the currency in front of a basket of important world currencies (they were UK£, US $, Japanese ¥, German Mark DM and the French Franc FFr). Different economies were supposed to maintain that particular exchange rate in future. Exchange rates of currencies were modified by the IMF from time to time.

:::


#### 

:::details Floating Currency Regime
- The floating currency regime5 is a method of regulating exchange rates of world currencies based on the market mechanism (i.e., demand and supply). In the follow up to the fixed currency system of exchange rate determination, it was the UK which blamed the system for its payment crisis of late 1960s. Looking at the major loopholes in this system, the UK government decided to switch over to the floating currency regime in 1973—the same year the IMF allowed an option to its member countries to go for either of the currency systems. In the floating exchange rate system, a domestic currency is left free to float against a number of foreign currencies in its foreign exchange market and determine its own value. Such exchange rates, are also called as market driven or based exchange rates, which are regulated by factors such as the demand and supply of the domestic and the foreign currencies in the concerned economy.

####
:::details :hand: Managed Exchange Rates
- A managed-exchange-rate system is a hybrid or mixture of the fixed and flexible exchange rate systems in which the government of the economy attempts to affect the exchange rate directly by buying or selling foreign currencies or indirectly, through monetary policy6 (i.e., by lowering or raising interest rates on foreign currency bank accounts, affecting foreign investment, etc.). Today, most of the economies have shifted to this system of exchange rate determination. Almost all countries tend to intervene when the markets become disorderly or the fundamentals of economics are challenged by the exchange rate of the time. Some of the major examples of the managed exchange-rate system have been given below:7 (i)     Some countries allow to free float their currencies and allow the market forces to determine their exchange rate with rare government intervention. This is the idea from which the floating currency regime basically emerged. The USA and the EU are the major examples in this category.

## Exchange Rate of Rupee

####
:::details Exchange Rate
- The exchange rate determines the value of one country's currency in another country's currency.
- Exchange rates affect many aspects of life, from grocery costs to interest rates and employment opportunities.
- Exchange rates can be flexible, changing constantly, or fixed, rarely changing.
- Flexible exchange rates are determined by the foreign exchange market and fluctuate on a moment-by-moment basis.
- Fixed exchange rates are controlled by the government and central bank, often pegged to the U.S. dollar.
- Exchange rates are influenced by factors such as interest rates, money supply, and financial stability.

:::

#### 
:::details Exchange Rate of Rupee
- Exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another currency. 
- For example, approximately 70 rupees are exchanged for $1 US in mid–2019. That is the exchange rate of rupee. 
- In 1991, it was less than 20 rupees. 
- The difference is largely because at that time the exchange rate was set by the RBI arbitrarily and today it is left to market forces. 
- The exchange rate depends upon many factors:
  - Growth rate of the economy 
  - Future potential 
  - Foreign trade profile which includes import dependency 
  - Inflation 
  - Forex reserves with the RBI 
  - Interest rates in the country 
  - Monetary policy of countries like USA 
  - Currency manipulation by a large country like China that forces India to also weaken its currency to some extent to retain its exports 
  - International commodity prices 
  - External debt levels, particularly the short-term commercial debt level 
  - Twin deficits–fiscal and external current account 
  - Political stability

:::details What does Rupee Depreciation means?
-  In foreign exchange market, it is a situation when domestic currency loses its value in front of a foreign currency if it is market-driven. It means depreciation in a currency can only take place if the economy follows the floating exchange rate system. 
-  With a weaker rupee:
   - Exports pick up
   - FPIs flow in
   - Remittances increase
   - Inessential imports reduce
   - More money in rupee terms is realized for the loans in foreign currency that Indian firms take 
:::

:::details However, when rupee loses its value externally:
- Debt servicing becomes costlier
- Inflation rises as imports become costlier

:::details What does  Devaluation  means?
- In the foreign exchange market when exchange rate of a domestic currency is cut down by its government against any foreign currency, it is called devaluation. It means official depreciation is devaluation.

#### 
:::details Rupee Appreciation
- In foreign exchange market, if a free floating domestic currency increases its value against the value of a foreign currency, it is appreciation. In domestic economy, if a fixed asset has seen increase in its value it is also known as appreciation. Appreciation rates for different assets are not fixed by any government as they depend upon many factors which are unseen.

## Forex Reserves

:::details Forex Reserves
- The total foreign currencies (of different countries) an economy possesses at a point of time is its ‘foreign currency assets/reserves’.2 
- The Forex Reserves (short for ‘foreign exchange reserves’) of an economy is its ‘foreign currency assets’ added with its gold reserves, SDRs (Special Drawing Rights) and Reserve Tranche Position (RTP) in the IMF.3 
- In a sense, the Forex reserves is the upper limit upto which an economy can manage foreign currency in normal times if need be. 
- By January 2020 (as per the RBI), the details related to India’s forex reserves were as given below (compared with January 2019):
  -    Foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 461.2 billion (up from US$ 397 billion).
  - This included Gold Reserves of US$ 28 billion and India’s total Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) of US$ 13.1 billion with the IMF (inclusive of Reserve Tranche Position, i.e., 25 per cent of the total SDRs if they have not been used). 
  -   Forex provided an import cover of 11 months (down from 11.5 months). Import cover of reserves is a trade-based indicator of reserve adequacy, which is an important parameter in gauging a country’s ability to absorb external shocks. 
  -    Forex cover ratio of external debt was at 82.5 per cent (up from 77.8 per cent).

#### Forex Reserves
:::details Forex Reserves -thebalance
- Forex reserves are foreign currencies held by a country's central bank, such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
- These reserves consist of banknotes, deposits, bonds, treasury bills, and other government securities, along with gold reserves and Special Drawing Reserves (SDRs).
- Forex reserves serve as a nation's backup funds for emergencies like rapid currency devaluation.
- Most reserves are held in U.S. dollars, with China having the highest foreign currency reserve in U.S. dollars.
- Countries use forex reserves to maintain a fixed rate value, competitively price exports, remain liquid during crises, and instill investor confidence.
- Reserves are also used to pay external debts, fund sectors of the economy, and diversify portfolios for profit.
:::

 

#### 
:::details How Forex Reserves Work
- Exporters deposit foreign currency into local banks, which then transfer the currency to the central bank.
- Exporters receive payment in foreign currencies like U.S. dollars or euros, which they exchange for local currency to pay workers and suppliers.

:::


#### 
:::details  Purpose of Forex Reserves
- Forex reserves are used to keep the value of currencies at a fixed rate in a Fixed Exchange Rate System, as seen in China.
- Countries with a floating exchange rate system use reserves to keep their currency value lower than the dollar for competitive reasons.
- Reserves maintain liquidity during economic crises, allowing central banks to exchange foreign currency for local currency to pay for imports.
- Forex reserves provide confidence to foreign investors, assuring them that the central bank is ready to protect their investments.
- Reserves are necessary to meet a country's external obligations, including international payment obligations, sovereign and commercial debts, and unexpected capital movements.
- Some countries use reserves to fund sectors like infrastructure, as seen in China.
- Central banks aim to boost returns without compromising safety by diversifying their portfolios, often holding gold and other safe, interest-bearing investments.

## Currency Intervention
:::details 
- Currency intervention occurs when a country's central bank trades its own currency on foreign exchanges to influence its value.
- For example, a central bank might buy its own currency to increase its value.
- This is also known as foreign exchange intervention or forex intervention.

- Central banks may intervene in currency markets if they perceive their currency is appreciating or depreciating too rapidly. This intervention can influence the currency's movement in either direction.
- Currency interventions often aim to keep the value of a domestic currency lower relative to foreign currencies. This is because higher currency valuations make exports less competitive, as their price is higher when purchased in a foreign currency.
- Conversely, a lower currency valuation reduces the relative cost of a country's exports, potentially increasing exports and stimulating economic growth.
- For example, if the U.S. wants to decrease the value of the dollar, the Federal Reserve (Fed) will sell U.S. dollars. If the U.S. wants to increase the value of the dollar, the Fed will buy more U.S. dollars.
- To maintain a consistent amount of money in bank reserves during these transactions, the Fed will "sterilize" the intervention by selling or buying bonds in proportion to the size of the currency intervention.
- Despite the large amounts of money involved in central bank currency interventions, their values are not as significant in the scope of total forex trading. Therefore, currency intervention does not immediately increase or decrease a currency's value. Instead, it signals the direction that a country's government is trying to push its currency, potentially influencing investors' decisions.
- Currency depreciation in the foreign exchange market refers to a situation where a domestic currency loses its value against a foreign currency due to market forces. This can only occur if the economy follows a floating exchange rate system.
- In the domestic economy, depreciation refers to an asset losing its value due to use, wear and tear, or other economic factors. This is also known as capital consumption.
- Devaluation in the foreign exchange market refers to a situation where the exchange rate of a domestic currency is reduced by its government against a foreign currency.
- Revaluation in the foreign exchange market refers to a situation where a government increases the exchange rate of its currency against a foreign currency.
- Currency appreciation is the increase in value of one country’s currency relative to another country’s currency. This can be caused by government policy and an increase in investment demand. When a currency appreciates relative to another currency, the goods of that country become more expensive, potentially reducing exports.
- The way a currency appreciates depends on the exchange rate system. There are three exchange rate systems: floating exchange regime, fixed exchange regime, and a managed float regime.
- In a floating exchange rate system, a currency’s value fluctuates with supply and demand created by capital flows. In a fixed exchange rate system, countries intervene in the foreign exchange market to maintain the value of their currencies relative to another currency. In a managed float system, currency appreciation will have some elements from both a floating exchange rate system and a fixed exchange rate system.
- External debt refers to the total amount of debt a country owes to foreign creditors. As India has managed its balance of payment more prudently after the reform period, its external debt position has improved significantly.
- Trade balance refers to the monetary difference between the total export and import of an economy in one financial year. It can be either positive or negative, known as either favourable or unfavourable, respectively.
- Trade policy, also known as the foreign trade policy or the Exim Policy, is the economic policy that regulates the export-import activities of an economy. This policy requires regular modifications depending on the economic policies of the world economies or the trading partners.
- Private transfers mainly represent remittances by Indians employed overseas. India continues to be the largest remittance recipient country in the world.
- The current account in the external sector refers to the account maintained by every government of the world in which every kind of current transactions is shown. In India, this current account of the central government is maintained by the RBI on behalf of the central government.

## Currency Forms
:::details 
- The balance of payment (BoP) of an economy is the net result of all its transactions with foreign economies within a year.
- Essentially, it is the net result of the current and capital accounts of an economy, which can be either favourable or unfavourable.
- A negative BoP is detrimental to an economy if it lacks the resources to offset the negativity.
- The BoP is calculated based on accountancy principles (double-entry book-keeping), resembling a company's balance sheet, with every entry recorded as either credit (inflow) or debit (outflow).
- If the year ends with a positive outcome, the money is automatically transferred to the economy's foreign exchange reserves.
- Conversely, if the outcome is negative, the foreign exchange is drawn from the country’s forex reserves.
- If the forex reserves are insufficient to cover the negativity created by the BoP, it results in a BoP crisis. The economy then explores various means to resolve the crisis, with seeking forex assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as the last resort.

#### 
:::details Hard Currency
- Hard currency is a highly trusted international currency required by every economy.
- The most potent currency is one with high liquidity.
- An economy with diversified exports that are essential imports for other countries will create high demand for its currency, making it a hard currency.
- Hard currency is always scarce.
- The US Dollar replaced the Pound Sterling (£) as the leading hard currency after the Second World War. Other prominent hard currencies include the Euro( €), Japanese Yen¥), and the UK Sterling Pound (£).
- In late 2015, the IMF allowed the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) to be denominated in the Chinese ‘Yuan’, introducing a new hard currency in 2016.

:::


#### 
:::details Soft Currency
- Soft currency refers to a currency that is readily available in an economy's forex market. For instance, the Rupee is a soft currency in the Indian forex market.
- It is essentially the opposite of hard currency.

:::


#### 

:::details Hot Currency
- Hot currency is a temporary term for any hard currency that is rapidly exiting an economy. For example, the US dollar became a hot currency during the Southeast Asian crisis.


:::

#### 
:::details  Heated Currency
- Heated currency refers to a domestic currency under significant pressure (heat) of depreciation due to the rapid exit of a hard currency (which has become hot).
- It is also known as a currency under heat or under hammering.
