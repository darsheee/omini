Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total value of everything produced within a country's borders. When economists talk about the "size" of the economy, they are referring to GDP.

How GDP Works
To avoid double-counting, GDP includes the final value of the product, but not the parts that go into it.1

 For example, a U.S. footwear manufacturer uses shoelaces and other materials made in the U.S., but only the value of the shoe gets counted; the shoelaces don't. In the U.S., the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) measures GDP quarterly, and it revises the quarterly estimate every month as it receives updated data.

How to Calculate GDP
The components of GDP include personal consumption expenditures (C), business investments (I), government spending (G), exports (X), and imports (M). GDP is equal to C + I + G + (X - M).

Types of GDP Measurements
There are many different ways to measure a country's GDP, so it's important to know all the different types and how they are used. A country's nominal GDP is the raw measurement that includes price increases. It's also known as the "current-dollar" GDP because it is measured with current market prices.2 At the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, the nominal U.S. GDP was $24 trillion.3

Real GDP
What makes real GDP so incredibly real?

Real gross domestic product (GDP) is a measurement of economic output that accounts for the effects of inflation or deflation. It provides a more realistic assessment of growth than nominal GDP. Without real GDP, it could seem like a country is producing more when it's only that prices have gone up.


To get the real GDP, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) removes the effects of inflation. The real GDP allows economists to compare figures from different years. Otherwise, it might seem like the economy is growing when it's actually suffering from double-digit inflation. The BEA calculates real GDP by using a price deflator, which tells you how much prices have changed since a base year.

Incomes from U.S. companies and people from outside the country are not included, which removes the impact of exchange rates and trade policies. Real GDP is lower than nominal GDP, and at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, it was $19.8trillion.4 The BEA uses 2012 as the base year for its real GDP data.

::: tip
Real GDP measures an economy’s total goods and services in a given year, taking into account changes in price levels.
It allows you to compare GDP by year because it takes into account inflation.
It’s a good indicator of where the economy is in the business cycle.
Knowing real GDP trends can help you prepare for recessions or make good financial decisions.
:::

Real GDP Compared to Nominal GDP
When you hear reports of a country’s GDP that don’t specify the type of GDP, it is likely to be nominal GDP. Nominal GDP includes both prices and growth, while real GDP is pure growth. It’s what nominal GDP would have been if there were no price changes from the base year. As a result, the nominal GDP is higher.1

The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reports both real and nominal GDP. It calculates real U.S. GDP as an annual rate from a designated base year. It excludes imports and foreign income from American companies and people. 

The line chart below shows the annual rates for both the U.S. real and nominal GDPs from 2012 to 2019. Hover over each point to compare the differences between both GDPs.

How to Calculate Real GDP
The formula for real GDP is nominal GDP divided by the deflator:

R = N/D.
For example, real GDP was $19.073 trillion in 2019. The nominal GDP was $21.427 trillion. The deflator was 1.1234.23

$19.073 trillion = $21.427 trillion/1.1234.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) calculates the deflator for the United States.4 It measures inflation since the designated base year. That is the ratio of what it would cost today compared to the base year. It's similar to the Consumer Price Index but is weighted differently. 

The BEA publishes so-called implicit price deflators in the national income products account or NIPA table 1.1.9. You can find it in the Interactive Tables section of the BEA website.56

How It Measures Production
Real GDP measures the final output of all goods and services produced in the United States in the prior quarter. It only counts final production. The BEA does not count the parts manufactured to make the car, such as tires, steering wheel, or engine.7

The GDP components report divides production into categories, so you can tell what contributes the most to the economy.8


How It Measures Services
Real GDP also measures services. These include your hairdresser, your bank, and even the services provided by non-profits such as Goodwill. It includes services provided by the U.S. military, even when troops are overseas. It also measures housing services provided by and for persons who own and live in their homes, including maid service.

But the BEA doesn't count some services because they're too difficult to measure. These include unpaid childcare, eldercare or housework, volunteer work for charities, or illegal or black-market activities.9 The book The Real Wealth of Nations argues that the exclusion of these services provides a false measurement of true U.S. production.

Why Real GDP Is Used to Calculate Growth
Real GDP is used to compute economic growth. The percentage change in real GDP is the GDP growth rate. You need to use real GDP so you can be sure you’re calculating real growth, not just price and wage increases. Here's how to calculate the GDP growth rate.

Real GDP can then be used to determine if the U.S. economy is growing more quickly or more slowly than the quarter before, or the same quarter the year before. In this way, you can tell where the economy is in the business cycle. Here's the real U.S. GDP growth rate for every year since 1929.

The ideal GDP growth rate is typically between 2% and 3%.10 The BEA revises its quarterly estimate each month when it receives new data. 

The GDP growth rate is critical for investors to adjust the asset allocation in their portfolios. They also compare countries' GDP growth rates. Countries with strong growth attract more investors for their corporate stocks, bonds, and even their sovereign debt.

The Federal Reserve reviews GDP growth when deciding on the fed funds rate. It will raise the rate when growth is too fast and lower it when growth is too slow.

Real GDP tells you how much the economy is producing. Real GDP can be used to compare the size of economies throughout the world. However, to compensate for the different costs of living between countries, you must use purchasing power parity.

Other ways to compare GDP by country is through calculation and comparison of official exchange rates and GDP per capita.

When You Should Use Nominal GDP Instead
You must use nominal GDP when your other variables don't exclude inflation. For example, if you are comparing debt to GDP, you've got to use nominal GDP since a country's debt is also nominal. To see the historical trend of U.S. debt to nominal GDP for every year, go as far back as 1929.

How GDP Affects You
When the GDP growth rate is slowing down or even contracting, the Fed will lower interest rates to stimulate growth. If you are buying a home when this happens, you'd want an adjustable-rate mortgage so you can take advantage of future lower rates. You might even want to think about downsizing.

Declining GDP growth rates can also lead to a recession, which means you should prepare for layoffs. If GDP growth rates are increasing, then you'd want to consider a fixed-rate mortgage. That way, you can lock in low-interest rates, because the Fed raises them if growth is too fast.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How do you find the real GDP?
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis maintains a chart with quarterly GDP data going back to the 1940s. The chart makes it easy to quickly compare the most recent GDP figures to previous periods.

Why is real GDP a more accurate measurement than nominal GDP?
Real GDP is not a more accurate measurement, but it allows for more accurate comparisons. Someone who wants to compare GDP figures over the years should account for changes in the underlying currency. Someone who doesn't need that historical context might prefer to use nominal GDP.






GDP Growth Rate
The GDP growth rate is the percentage increase in GDP from quarter to quarter, and it changes as the economy moves through the business cycle. If the growth rate is negative, the economy contracts, and it signals a recession. If it contracts for years, that's a depression. If the growth rate is too high, it creates inflation. The BEA provides the U.S. GDP growth rate monthly, and at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, the U.S. nominal and real GDP increased by 7.1% and 6.9%, respectively.56

::: tip
Many economists agree that roughly 2% is an ideal growth rate that allows for sustainable economic growth.7 Rates that are faster than that can lead to inflation and asset bubbles, both of which can contribute to economic downturns.
:::

GDP Per Capita
Some countries have a big GDP only because of their large population. GDP per capita is the best way to compare GDP between countries because it divides the GDP by the number of residents, and measures the country's standard of living.

In the fourth quarter of 2021, the U.S. GDP per capita was $50,553.8 The best way to compare GDP per capita by year or between countries is with real GDP per capita. This takes out the effects of inflation, exchange rates, and differences in population. 

How GDP Affects You
GDP impacts personal finance, investments, and job growth. Investors look at a nation's growth rate to decide if they should adjust their asset allocation, as well as compare country growth rates to find their best international opportunities. They purchase shares of companies that are in rapidly growing countries.

::: warning
The Federal Reserve, the central bank in the U.S., uses the growth rate to determine monetary policy. 
:::
Interest Rates
The Fed implements expansionary monetary policy to ward off recession and contractionary monetary policy to prevent inflation. Its primary tool is the federal funds rate. For example, if the growth rate is increasing, then the Fed raises interest rates to stem inflation.

The federal funds rate affects any interest rate you encounter in your life, from mortgages to personal loans to yields on your savings account. In this example, the Fed is raising rates, so you should lock in a fixed-rate mortgage. Your payments on an adjustable-rate mortgage would rise along with the fed funds rate.

Unemployment
If growth slows or becomes negative, then you should update your resume because low economic growth leads to layoffs and unemployment. It may take a few months to see the corresponding job loss because it takes time for executives to compile the layoff list and prepare exit packages, but when economic growth slows, it's inevitable for many companies. This delay between economic growth rates and the impact on individual workers makes unemployment a lagging indicator.

Finding Opportunities During Downturns
The BEA offers breakdowns of GDP data that examine specific sectors and products. You can use these details to determine which sectors of the economy are growing and which are declining. Even during hard economic times, particular sectors continue to add jobs, such as the health care industry during the 2008 financial crisis.9 This report also helps you determine whether you should invest in, say, a tech-specific mutual fund instead of a fund that focuses on agribusiness.

Problems With GDP
The GDP is designed to measure the market value for all products and services within a country's borders. Since the measurement hinges on market price, there are many aspects of society—including many aspects that factor into economic well-being—that aren't included in the GDP numbers.10

One of the biggest criticisms of GDP is that it doesn't count environmental costs.11 For example, the price of plastic is low because it doesn't include the cost of pollution. GDP doesn't measure how these costs impact the well-being of society. A more accurate measurement of a country's standard of living may include environmental conditions.

Another criticism is that GDP doesn't include unpaid services.12 It leaves out unpaid child care and volunteer work, for example, despite the significant impact they have on the economy and a country's quality of life.

GDP also does not count the shadow or black economy. It underestimates economic output in countries where many people receive their income from illegal activities. These products aren't taxed and don't show up in government records, and although they can estimate, they cannot accurately measure this output. One estimate that is referenced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics pegs the shadow economy's size as 8.8% of the GDP.13

## Gross National Product 
and How It Is Calculated
Find out how GNP compares with GDP


<ZoomImg src="/upsc-gs3/indian_economy/illustration/gnp v gdp-1000w.avif"
         alt="GNP v GDP "
         width="700" height="100"/>


Gross national product (GNP) is the value of all goods and services made by a country's residents and businesses, regardless of production location. GNP counts the investments made by U.S. residents and businesses—both inside and outside the country—and computes the value of all products manufactured by domestic companies, regardless of where they are made.12

GNP doesn't count any income earned in the United States by foreign residents or businesses and excludes products manufactured in the United States by overseas firms.

:::tip
- Gross national product (GNP) offers a way to measure all of the goods and services produced by a country's residents and businesses.
- To calculate GNP, add national consumption to investment, net exports, and net income earned by domestic residents from overseas investment (minus net income earned by foreign residents from domestic investments).
- GNP is similar to gross domestic product (GDP), but GDP is more geographically restricted because it doesn't account for income from overseas investments.
:::

GNP Formula
The formula to calculate the components of GNP is Y = C + I + G + X + Z. 

That stands for GNP = Consumption + Investment + Government + X (net exports) + Z (net income earned by domestic residents from overseas investments minus net income earned by foreign residents from domestic investments).34 

Examples of GNP
Any domestic business or industry provides an example of GNP. These categories include retail stores, real estate transactions, food services, and more. For example, when you buy dinner at a local restaurant, that helps the restaurant generate profits that contribute to the food service industry's total impact on GNP. When you attend a music concert or go see a movie at the theaters, you contribute to the category arts, entertainment, and recreation.
GNP vs. GDP
U.S. GNP says a lot about the financial well-being of Americans and U.S.-based multinational corporations, but it doesn't give much insight into the health of the U.S. economy. For that, you should use gross domestic product (real or nominal)—which measures production inside of a country, no matter who makes it.

::: danger
GNP is the same as GDP + Z.5 That means GNP is a more accurate measure of a country's income than its production.
:::

Examples of GNP vs. GDP
The output of a Toyota plant in Kentucky isn't included in GNP, although it's counted in GDP, because the revenue from the sales of Toyota vehicles goes to Japan, even though the products are made and sold in the United States. It is included in GDP because it adds to the health of the U.S. economy by creating jobs for Kentucky residents, who use their wages to buy local goods and services.

Similarly, the shoes made in a Nike plant in Korea will be counted in U.S. GNP, but not GDP, because the profits from those shoes will boost Nike's earnings and stock prices, contributing to higher national income. It doesn't stimulate economic growth in the United States because those manufacturing jobs were outsourced. It's Korean workers who will boost their country's economy and GDP by buying local goods and services.

These examples show why GNP is not as commonly used as GDP as a measure of a country's economy. It gives a slightly inaccurate picture of how domestic resources are used. For instance, if there were a severe drought in the United States, GNP would be higher than GDP because the foreign holdings of U.S. residents would be unaffected by the drought, unlike the U.S. investments of foreign workers.

::: warning
GNP is also affected by changes in a country's currency exchange rates. If the dollar weakens, then the foreign holdings of U.S. residents become worth more, boosting GNP, but may not accurately reflect the state of the U.S. economy. A weaker dollar can eventually boost GDP, because it makes exports cheaper, which increases sales and production.
:::

The Bottom Line
While GDP is a measure of an economy’s health, GNP tells us about a country’s real income. GNP is the value of all the income earned by a country’s citizens and businesses, regardless of whether they are located in their own country or abroad.

Although GNP reflects the financial standing of a nation, GNP is not an accurate measure of economic health because:

Foreign exchange rates affect it.
It does not give an accurate picture of domestic resource usage.
It is not a good gauge of whether the economy is growing or contracting.
For these reasons, the United States ceased using GNP in 1991 as an indicator and adopted GDP instead.112 GDP is still commonly used internationally.13

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is included in both GNP and GDP?
GNP includes everything in GDP but adds the net income earned by domestic residents from overseas investments and takes out the net income earned by foreign residents from domestic investments.

When would an economist focus on GNP rather than GDP?
GNP can be a helpful tool for comparing the incomes generated by different countries, since it considers net production value regardless of location. It provides a better view of the entire economic output of a country's citizens than GDP does.




## Gross National Income
#### What It Says About a Country
Gross National Income (GNI) is a measurement of a country's income. It includes all the income earned by a country's residents, businesses, and earnings from foreign sources. Income is defined as all employee compensation plus investment profits.

GNI also includes any product taxes not already counted, minus subsidies. It only counts income earned from residents who work abroad and does not count income earned by foreigners located in the country. Like GDP, it also does not include the shadow or black economy.

While GNI can be used for a few purposes, it is mostly used to classify and group economies using purchasing power parity and the per capita method to determine different countries' standard of living to each other.

:::tip
- Gross National Income (GNI), Gross National Product (GNP), and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are all measurements of a country's ability to produce and earn.
- GNI and GNP are based on GDP
- GNI is the total earned income of a country's residents.
:::

### Difference Between GNI and GDP
Gross domestic product measures the value of goods and services produced within a country; the measurement includes national output, expenditures, and income.

GNI equals GDP plus wages, salaries, and property income of the country's residents earned abroad and at home. It also includes net taxes and subsidies receivable from abroad, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Difference Between GNI and GNP
Gross national product includes the earnings from all assets owned by residents. It even includes earnings that don't flow back into the country. It then omits the earnings of all foreigners living in the country, even if they spend it within the country. GNP only reports how much is earned by the country's citizens and businesses, no matter where it is spent in the world

| Income Earned by: | GDP | GNI | GNP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Residents in Country | C+I+G+X | C+I+G+X | C+I+G+X |
| Foreigners in Country | Includes | Includes If Spent in Country | Excludes All |
| Residents Out of Country | Excludes | Includes If Remitted Back | Includes All |
| Foreigners Out of Country | Excludes | Excludes | Excludes |


Calculating the Measurements
To put things in a simpler form, here are the formulas to calculate GDP, GNI, and GDP.

The components of GDP are:
- Personal consumption (C)
- Business investment (I)
- Government spending (G)
- Exports - imports (X) 
GDP is calculated as:
**GDP = C + I + G + X**

GNI uses GDP and two different types of income circumstances:

- Income from citizens and businesses earned abroad (A)
- Income remitted by foreigners living in the country back to their home countries (B)

This gives the formula:
**GNI = GDP + [ ( A ) – ( B ) ]**


To calculate GNP, GDP is used again, with two types of income that are different from those used to calculate GNI:

- Income earned on all foreign assets (C)
- Income earned by foreigners in the country (D)
- The formula then becomes: **GNP = GDP + (C – D)**

Why These Differences Are Important
In many emerging markets, such as India, residents move to other countries where they can earn a better living. Many workers that do this send money back to their families in their home county. There is enough of this type of income that it influences economic metrics. It's counted in GNI and GNP but not in GDP.

As a result, comparisons of GDP by country will understate the size of these countries' economies because of the missing financial data (known as worker's remittances)—remittances count for close to 6% of lower-income countries' GDP.3


## Fiscal Policy



 <ZoomImg src="/upsc-gs3/indian_economy/illustration/fiscal-policy-types-1000w.avif"
         alt="Fiscal Policy Types "
         width="700" height="100"/>

"Fiscal policy" refers to decisions the U.S. government makes about spending and collecting taxes and how these policy changes influence the economy. When the government makes financial decisions, it has to consider the effect those decisions will have on businesses, consumers, foreign markets, and other interested entities.

Learn what fiscal policy is, how it works, and how the government uses it to influence the U.S. economy.

Definition and Examples of Fiscal Policy
"Fiscal policy" is the term used to describe the actions a government takes to influence an economy by purchasing products and services from businesses and collecting taxes.

Alternate definition: Fiscal policy also refers to the economic intent behind the decisions for how the money is used.
For example, governments can lower taxes and raise spending to boost the economy if needed; typically, they spend on infrastructure projects that create jobs and income and social programs.

Or, if the economy is doing well, a government can reduce spending and increase taxes. Businesses create enough jobs at these times so officials can reduce the amount spent on goods and services from the private sector.

How Fiscal Policy Works
Economies follow an oscillating pattern where they expand, peak, contract, and trough. This pattern is often called the business or economic cycle. When an economy is experiencing growth—expanding—employment rates and consumer income are generally higher. Business profits are high, investors are happy, and the population spends more on luxury and non-necessity items.

When the economy contracts, investors begin to turn to capital preservation strategies, businesses start cutting expenses, and unemployment tends to rise. Consumers generally have less income and begin to save more than they spend.

:::
Fiscal policy is used in conjunction with the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve (the Fed), which uses the supply of money and interest rates to influence inflation and lending.
:::
The objectives of fiscal and monetary policy are to control the expansion and contraction of the economy. During a recession, the government works to keep money in the accounts of businesses and consumers, and The Fed works to increase lending and spending. In a boom, they do the opposite.

The government has two tools it uses when implementing fiscal policy. The first tool is collecting taxes on business and personal income, capital gains, property, and sales. Taxes provide the revenue that funds the government.

The second tool is government spending—funds are directed into subsidies, welfare programs, public works, infrastructure projects, and government jobs. Government spending puts more money back into the economy, which increases demand for products and services.

Types of Fiscal Policy
Legislators can take two types of measures to control economic swings—discretionary fiscal policies and automatic stabilizers. Automatic stabilizers are tools built into federal budgets that adjust taxes and spending. They create automated fiscal actions if specific economic conditions are met. Discretionary fiscal policies are the measures most commonly referred to when fiscal policy is talked about. The government has two types of discretionary fiscal policy options—expansionary and contractionary.

:::
Each type of fiscal policy is used during different phases of the economic cycle to stop or slow recessions and booms.
:::

Expansionary Fiscal Policy 
Expansionary fiscal policy involves the measures taken by the government to put more money back into the economy. This generally creates demand for products and services. It creates jobs and increases profits—stimulating economic growth.

Congress uses it to slow the contraction phase of the business cycle—usually called a "recession." The government either spends more, cuts taxes, or does both. The idea is to put more money into consumers' hands to induce them to spend more. The increased demand forces businesses to add jobs to increase supply, output, and consumer spending.

Contractionary Fiscal Policy
The second type of fiscal policy is contractionary, used during economic booms. Since expansions can also be dangerous for an economy, the government tries to slow them down lest they become too intense.

Too much growth can fuel investor exuberance and overconfidence (as well as greed), creating market bubbles or other unforeseen economic dangers. Contractionary fiscal policies are enacted to try to slow growth to a more manageable level and control inflation.

The government begins collecting more taxes and reduces spending to keep investment prices down and to raise the unemployment rate. The economy needs a certain amount of unemployed workers for businesses to hire—if companies can't find workers, production growth slows down.

:::
The U.S. economy tends to spend more time expanding than contracting.1
This means the government uses contractionary fiscal policies more than it does expansionary fiscal policies.
:::

Fiscal Policy vs. Monetary Policy
Monetary policy differs from fiscal policy in that decisions are made to change the U.S dollar's purchasing power, and interest rates are managed to influence the economy. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) creates changes that increase or decrease the supply of money or the federal funds rate—the interest rate that influences all others.

The Federal Reserve (the Fed) has several tools to increase and decrease interest rates or the dollar value. Most common are raising or lowering the "interest on reserve balances" (IORB)  and "overnight reverse repurchase agreements" (ON RRP). These two tools are used at the same time to influence the federal funds rate.

:::tip
When interest rates are high, the money supply contracts, the economy cools down, and inflation is prevented. When interest rates are low, the money supply expands, the economy heats up, and a recession is usually avoided.
:::
Monetary policy works more quickly than fiscal policy. The Federal Open Market Committee meets eight times per year and votes to raise or lower rates. However, it can take up to six months for rate changes to impact the economy.2

::: warning
Fiscal policy refers to decisions the U.S. government makes about spending and collecting taxes in order to regulate the economy.
The government uses expansionary policy during a recession, and contractionary policy during an economic boom.
Monetary policy acts more directly on interest rates to affect the value of the dollar, whereas fiscal policy works at higher levels to affect consumer spending.
The U.S. government took a more robust approach to fiscal policy as a result of the Great Depression.
:::

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Why would a tax increase stimulate the economy?
The health of the economy overall is a complex equation, and no one factor acts alone to produce an obvious effect. However, when the government raises taxes, it's usually with the intent or outcome of greater spending on infrastructure or social welfare programs. These changes can create more jobs, greater consumer security, and other large-scale effects that boost the economy in the long run.

What does "laissez-faire" mean?
The French term "laissez faire" literally translates to "allow to do." It embodies a philosophy that calls for the government to take a very hands-off approach, and let things play out as they may. In economic terms, it is often accompanied by the capitalist idea that a market will regulate itself. However, a more modern approach in the U.S. is to use fiscal policy tools to keep the economy from reaching dangerous extremes, for the good of the people.
