# Investment Models

### INVESTMENT MODELS

### Definition of investment

- Investment is a process of putting money in productive activities to earn income
- It can be done directly (in different activities in the primary, secondary or tertiary sectors) or indirectly (as in financial securities, such as shares, debentures, bonds, mutual funds, etc.)

### Importance of investment for an economy

- Investment is a **means and tools** by which the Government tries to mobilise required funds (resources) to promote the different goals of planned development
- The level of income, output and employment in an economy depends upon effective demand, which, in turn, depends upon expenditures on consumption goods and investment goods (Y= C + I)
- Investment is a component of **aggregate demand**; changes in investment shift the aggregate demand curve by the amount of the initial change times the multiplier
- Investment changes the capital stock; changes in the capital stock shift the production possibilities curve and the economy’s aggregate production function

### Classification of investment

- **Debt Investments**
  - Debt-based investments can be further broken down into two sub-categories –
  - **Public investments**
    - These are investments that can be purchased or traded in open debt markets. These are such things as bonds, debentures, and credit swaps, among others
  - **Non-public (private) investments**
    - These are any transactions that generate an asset on the balance sheet and are not openly or easily traded in markets. An example is the purchasing of another entity’s accounts receivables or loan receivables
  - **Equity Investments**
    - These are seen as riskier than debt investments, with the advantage of potentially generating higher returns
    - **Public equity investments** are any equity-based investments that can be purchased or traded in markets
      - These are often the type of investments that someone has in mind when discussing investments
      - This covers such instruments ascommon stock, preferred stock, stock options, and stock warrants
    - **Private equity investments** are often larger-scale investments that are not within the scope of a small investor

### Factors affecting investment

- **Agriculture**

  - The majority of the population in India is engaged either in agriculture or in its allied activities and it contributes considerably to the growth of the Indian economy
  - With the increasing agricultural income, the demand for industrial products and services increases
  - Hence, the performance of agricultural sector has a great bearing on industrial production and corporate performance in our country

- **Change in the level of National Income or GDP**
  - If the level of national income keeps on increasing, it is likely to result in a continuous rising demand for customer goods in the market
  - Since consumption is a function of income, at higher levels of GDP, people are likely to spend more on consumer goods. The higher consumption expenditure would mean higher demand for goods and more revenue to the producers
  - To meet the increasing demand for consumer goods and make larger profits by increasing their production, the entrepreneurs would naturally go in for purchase of new capital equipment and thus increase the investment to rise
  - On the other hand, a fall in GDP and a consequent reduction in the demand for consumer good would reduce the demand for capital goods and thus, affect the level of investment in an adverse manner.
- **Inflation**
  - Higher rates of inflation erode purchasing power of consumers, thereby resulting in lower demand for products; thereby affecting the performance of industries and hence the investment
- **Rates of interest**
  - Having worked out the marginal efficiency of capital(MEC), the investors would compare it with the market rate of interest, because while the MEC denotes the returns to capital, the rate of interest is its cost; i.e. cost of borrowing funds for investment
  - Hence, reduction in the market rate of interest would encourage investment, while any risen in it would discourage new investment.
- **Innovation and Technical Progress**
  - Both innovations and technical progress move hand-in-hand and open up more profitable opportunities for the entrepreneurs.
  - This leads to a much greater demand for capital goods and increase the volume of investment
- **Population Growth**
  - Rapid expansion in the size of population offers more markets for the goods
  - The investor, in expectation of a higher demand and greater profitability, would naturally like to make expansion in their plant and equipment and thus, undertake more new investments
  - The economics history of the modern advanced nation’s shows that the period of rapid population growth have also been the periods of massive outbursts in investment activity
- **Rates of Taxation and Government Policy**
  - Tax forms a deduction from the income of the entrepreneurs and thus high rates of taxation reduce the amount received by the entrepreneurs, thereby reducing the expected profitability of investment
  - Higher rates of taxation, thus act as deterrent to investment, whereas low tax rates, or tax exemption, will provide an incentive for investment
  - Similarly, if the government gives increased subsidies to the new entrepreneurs and provide them other benefits, this might act as incentives for new investment

### Various investment models

### Public investment model

- Here, Government makes investments in specific goods and services, with the help of Public sector
- The investment for revenue mainly comes from taxes
- Properly targeted public investment can do much to boost economic performance, generating aggregate demand quickly, fuelling productivity growth by improving human capital, encouraging technological innovation, and spurring private-sector investment by increasing returns
- Though public investment cannot fix a large demand shortfall overnight, it can accelerate the recovery and establish more sustainable growth patterns

### Private investment model

- When there exists certain shortfall of earnings in the public sector, Government invites private players to invest in some of its ventures
- The private investment can be domestic or foreign in nature
- A foreign direct investment (FDI) can improve the current infrastructure and generate employment in the process.
  - This model is one of the most sought after when it comes to external investment
- Also, Private investment can generate more efficiency by creating more competition, realization of economies of scale and greater flexibility than is available to the public sector

### Public private partnership model

- PPPs are formal arrangements between public and private counterparties to share risks and rewards in the delivery of public services and infrastructure
- These partnerships work well when private sector technology and innovation combine with public sector incentives to complete work on time and within budget
- PPP involves full retention of responsibility by the government for providing the services, and it **doesn’t amount to privatization**
- Private entity is chosen on the basis of open competitive bidding and receives performance linked payments
- PPP route can be alternative in developing countries where governments face various constraints on borrowing money for important projects

**Public private partnership (PPP) Models**

- The major types of PPP model are:
  - **Management Contract Model**
    - Under this model, a private entity is given the contract to manage, either in part or in whole, a public facility or a service
    - In this model, Ownership of the asset, or facility, remains with the public entity (government); while the day-to-day operations of such facility are transferred to the private entity
    - The risk exposure for the private entity is low since it is not required to make any capital investments and the private entity is allowed to collect a fee which is predetermined
  - **Lease Contract Model**
    - Under this model, the asset is leased, either to the private entity or to the public entity, depending on the situation
    - The private entity is allowed to earn revenue from operations
    - **Build-Lease-Transfer model**
      - The asset is owned by the private entity and is leased to public entity for medium term
      - Here, public entity is responsible for making the capital investment
    - **Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) Model**
      - In BOT model, the public entity retains the ownership while the private entity bears the responsibility of construction(usually a greenfield project)
      - In second type, known as Under this model, the asset is leased, either to the private entity or to the public entity, depending on the situation
      - **BOT Annuity**
        - This model is adopted for the building highways, mainly for those projects where the potential for generating revenues is limited, by the NHAI
        - The private entity is responsible for designing, building, managing, and maintaining the asset. However, the risk for the private entity is low as it receives a fixed sum as annuity from the public entity at regular intervals throughout the duration of the contract
      - **Other related PPP models**
        - **Engineering-Procurement-Construction(EPC) Model**
          - In this model, the private entity is responsible for designing, financing and building the asset
          - After building the asset, it is transferred to the public entity which remains the owner. The private entity does not have the responsibility of operations and management and receives a lump-sum money from the public entity for its role. This model is being used for the construction of highways by the NHAI
        - **Hybrid Annuity Model(HAM)**
          - In this model, the public entity finances 40% of the project cost, and private entity has to finance the remaining 60%
          - The ownership, as well as operations, remain the responsibility of the public entity while the private entity only has to provide the engineering expertise

### Issues associated with PPP model

- Non-availability of capital and **Regulatory** hurdles related to Land Acquisition, are frequent associated issues
- They have been used as tool of **crony capitalism**, and as a means of accumulating land by private companies
  - Many PPP projects in infrastructure sector are run by “politically connected firms” which have used political connections to win contracts
- It is also argued that PPP is mere a ‘’language game” by governments who find it difficult to push privatization, or when politically it is difficult to contracting out
- According to **Economic Survey-2015**, many companies have been “over-leveraging” i.e. bidding beyond capacity and expecting government to redraw contracts
- The long term finance for PPP projects has dried up due to excessive dependence on banks and lack of proper corporate bond market in the country. Banks are further stressed due to high NPAs and governance issues
- According to Economic Survey 2015, PPPs have certain inherent **flaws in design**such as:
  - no re-negotiation structures resulting in Project stalling
  - wrongful risk allocation
  - focus on fiscal benefits rather than efficient service provision; no measures to penalise the providers for poor service

### Reforms undertaken to better PPP model in recent times

- Several infrastructure projects in India have been hit by various issues related to the Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) model
- It is in this context, the **Vijay Kelkar** panel recommended various measures for revival of PPP model. The panel was appointed by the Union Finance Ministry in the Union Budget 2015-16

- **The recommendations of Vijay Kelkar committee** are as follows:
  - It recommended for the strengthening of 3 main pillars of the PPP framework viz. **Governance, Institutions, and Capacity**. The report endorsed setting up of a 3PI (a PPP institute of excellence) for supporting institutional capacity building activities.
  - **The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988** should be amended at the earliest to punish corrupt practices while saving those who made genuine mistakes in decision-making.
  - **Swiss Challenge Method** of awarding contracts should be avoided as it discourages transparency.
    - Unsolicited Proposals encourages unequal treatment of potential bidders in the procurement process, so they should be discouraged.
  - For sourcing long-term capital at low-cost, banks and financial institutions should be encouraged to issue deep discount bonds, also known as zero coupon bonds. This will reduce the debt servicing charges during the initial period of the project.
  - After successful completion of the projects, equity in the project may be offered to long-term investors including overseas institutional buyers. The divestment amount would be utilized for new infrastructure projects.
  - **Independent sectoral regulators** should be set up as and when a new sector is declared to adopt PPP model.
    - The regulators should follow a unified approach. Without the independent regulators, the projects would be subjected to bureaucratic and political pressure.
  - For the rational allocation of risks among various stakeholders, **the Model Concession Agreement (MCA)** should be revisited. The “One-size-fits-all” approach should be avoided and project-specific risk assessment should be undertaken
  - It should be explored for extension of PPP into new sectors such as health, other social sectors, and urban transport
  - The private sector should be protected against any abrupt changes in the economic or policy environment
  - The government may develop a **PPP law** with an endorsement from Parliament. It gives an authoritative framework to implementing executives along with an oversight responsibility to the legislature and regulatory agencies
  - **Infrastructure PPP Project Review Committee (IPRC)** should be set up for evaluating and sending recommendations in a time-bound manner for a stress in projects under the PPP model
  - An **Infrastructure PPP Adjudication Tribunal (IPAT)** should be set up and its benches will be constituted by the Chairperson as per needs of the matter in question
  - The state-owned enterprises and public sector undertakings should not be allowed to bid for PPP projects. The PPP model meant for leveraging the managerial and operational efficiency of the private sector
  - A **dispute resolution mechanism** that is quick and flexible is needed to allow restructuring within the commercial and financial boundaries of the project
  - PPP model should not be recommended for small-scale projects in view of the transaction costs involved
