- Statutory responsibility given to the RBI for targeting inflation (CPI-C) while keeping in mind the objective of growth.
- The Monetary Policy Committee (has to meet 4 times minimum every year) has a total of 6 members nominated by RBI and the Ministry of Finance in equal numbers including the RBI Governor as its Chairman who avails the right of casting vote in case of a tie in decisions.

There are few types of monetary policy stances which keep coming into media from time to time—

- (i) **Neutral stance** means interest rates may move either way— upward or downward.
- (ii) **Calibrated tightening** means interest rates :arrow_double_up:
  can only move upward.
- (iii) **Accommodative stance** (also known as expansionary stance) means injection of more funds into the financial system. Falling ‘headline inflation’ inspires RBI for it and such a stance is aimed at expansion in lending, investment and growth.
- (iv) **Contractionary stance** means syphoning out of fund from the financial system. Such a stance is generally followed once more than optimum fund is believed to be available in the financial system. At times, it is also aimed at taming inflation in long-term.

### Liquidity Adjustment Facility
:::details Liquidity Adjustment Facility
- The LAF is the key element in the monetary policy of RBI.
- On daily basis, the RBI stands ready to lend to or borrow money from the banking system, as per the need of the time, at fixed interest rates (repo and reverse repo rates).
- Together with moderating the fund-mismatches of the banks, LAF operations help the RBI to effectively transmit interest rate signals to the market.
- <mark> **Repo Rate**</mark>
- <mark> **Reverse Repo Rate**</mark>
:::
### Repo Rate
:::details Repo Rate
- The **rate-of-interest** which <mark>the **RBI** charges from Banks</mark> on their short-term borrowing is called Repo Rate.
  - Basically, this is an abbreviated form of the ‘rate of hjre purchase’ and in western economies it is known as the ‘rate of discount’. 
  - The Call Money Market of India (inter-bank market) operates at this rate and banks use this route for overnight borrowings. 
- This rate has direct relation with the interest rates banks charge on customer loans they offer.
:::
<!-- ## Long Term Repo
- Aimed at promoting enhanced lending and cutting the cost of short-term funds for the banks.
- In a first of its kind move, in February 2020, the RBI announced to offer long term repo operation (LTRO) of ₹ 1.50 lakh crores at a fixed rate (i.e., at the Repo rate).
- The tenure of the LTRO will be from one to three years.
- This was aimed at ensuring permanent and deeper liquidity in the financial system together with enhancing lending by cutting cost of funds for the banks (enabling them to lend cheaper loans).  -->

### Reverse - Repo Rate
:::details Reverse - Repo Rate
- It is the which **rate-of-interest** <mark> which the RBI <u>pays</u> to Banks</mark> who offer short-term loans to RBI.
- It is the reverse of repo rate
- In practice, Banks **park their surplus funds with the RBI** for short-term period and earn money.
- It has a direct bearing on the interest rates
:::


:::details  Marginal Standing Facility
- MSF is a recent scheme/facility (2012) by RBI
- Under this scheme/facility, banks can borrow <mark>**overnight**</mark> up to 1% of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) from the RBI.
- The MSF rate is a **penal rate** & RBI maintained it 1% higher than the prevailing repo rate. So, as to discourage banks from over-lending.
:::

:::details Bank Rate
- The interest-rate which the **RBI charges** on its <mark>long-term lending’s</mark> to Banks, GOI, States, NBFCs is known as the Bank Rate.
:::

:::details Cash Reserve Ratio
- Banks are under regulatory obligation to maintain the cash reserve ratio
- Under it, all banks are supposed to maintain a part of their total deposits (NDTL) with the RBI <mark>**in cash form**</mark> as the cash reserve ratio (CRR).
:::

:::details Statutory Liquidity Ratio
- Banks are under regulatory obligation to maintain the statutory liquidity ratio
- Under it, all banks are supposed to maintain a part of their total deposits (NDTL) <u>_with themselves_</u> <mark>**in non-cash form**</mark> (in liquid assets)
- In practice, banks **are forced by RBI to invest in the G-Secs**.
- Banks earn income on this investment
:::

:::details Open Market Operations
- OMOs are conducted by the RBI via the sale/purchase of <mark>government securities (G-Secs)</mark> to/from the market with the **primary aim of modulating rupee liquidity/availability conditions in the economy**.
:::

:::details Call Money Market
- The call money market is an important segment of the money market where borrowing & lending of funds take place on **over-night basis**.
- Participants in the call money market in India currently include scheduled commercial banks (SCBs)— **excluding regional rural banks**), cooperative banks (other than land development banks), insurance.
:::

:::details Base Rate
- Base Rate is the interest rate below which Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) can't lend loans to its customers.
:::

:::details MCLR
- **Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rate**
- From 2016, banks have shifted to a **new methodology** to compute their Base Rate.
:::

:::details Market Stabilisation Scheme
- Surplus liquidity of a more enduring nature arising from large capital inflows is absorbed through sale of short-dated government securities and treasury bills.
- The mobilised cash is held in a separate government account with the Reserve Bank. The instrument thus has features of both, SLR and CRR.
:::

:::details Standing Deposit Facility/Scheme
- The scheme is aimed at helping RBI to manage liquidity in a better way, especially when the economy is flush with excess fund (as was seen after the demonetisation of the high value currency notes post- November 2016).
:::

:::details Liquidity Management Framework
 - A liquidity management framework (LMF) was provisioned to check volatility in the inter-bank call money market (CMM) and allow banks manage their needs of short-term capital.
- The combined repo borrowings of all banks put together on a day cannot be more than 1 per cent of the combined NDTL of the banks
 - Individual banks can borrow not more than 1 per cent of their NDTL under repo operation— 0.25 per cent of it as overnight repo and rest of the 0.75 per cent as term repo for 7/ 14/ 28 days.
 -  After exhausting the option of the various repos, banks can borrow upto 1 per cent of their NDTL directly from the RBI for one day (called overnight) under the marginal standing facility (MSF).
 - The long-term repo started by the RBI in February 2020 is an extra window over and above the 1 per cent upper cap on the repo operation. In a push to bring in more ‘stability’ and better ‘interest rate signalling’ in the loan market, the RBI has been trying to inspire banks to think in longer term in their operations. Aimed at making banks follow prudential norms, the Basel III norms also has put a clear check on short-termism followed by banking industry.
