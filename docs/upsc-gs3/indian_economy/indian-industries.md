Indian industry at the eve of independence
Characteristics of Indian industry from 1900 to eve of independence

Very Limited growth of modern Industries . At independence
Modern factory sector never employed more than 2% of labor force.
Modern industries only 7% of GDP
Per capita income increased only 20% between 1900 to 1947
Composition of Manufacturing: Consumer goods dominated the industrial production.
90% of core goods imported
Dominated by Textile Industry –
60% of Manufacturing output
next being engineering @ 8.4% and steel @ 7.6%
Absence of core sectors: A characteristic feature was under development of capital goods and modern banking and insurance sectors. India relied on imports to meet around 90% of its machinery needs in 1951.
Technology: Research institutions and research in companies almost non-existent. Indians not appointed to higher skilled jobs.
Gradual Indianisation,
By Independence, 60% of Industries, owned by Indians
In 1913, 60% under British
Regional Concentration : Regionally only a few states had industry. Only a few sectors like sugar, textiles etc. dominated whole industrial output.
De Industrialisation of Traditional Industries
Export orientation had been against country’s interests.
Male dominated

Major Industrial policies introduced in India since independence
BROAD POLICY AND REGULATION FRAMEWORK (BEFORE LIBERALIZATION)

MRTP (Monopolistic and Restrictive Trade Practice), 1969 (to check the expansion of industrial houses with assets > Rs. 20 cr ) Also reason for missing middle
FERA – Import export control. Before 1980 no FDI was allowed without transfer of technology. Renewals of foreign collaborations were restricted. Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 was restricted to FDI in certain core or high priority industries.
Industrial Disputes Act, 1976 (firms with > 300 workers had to take government permission before laying off workers)
Contract Labor Act, 1970 (firms can’t hire contract labor in industries where labor is seen to be essential to the main activity)
Urban Land Ceiling Act, 1976 (can’t own vacant land beyond the ceiling but gave discretionary powers to the state governments to exempt from ceiling)
over 800 items reserved for SSIs
In the wake of these regulations industrial growth, however fell from 6.3% to 4.1%. Overall manufacturing fell coupled with Decline in public investment in investment followed by decline in private investment, oil shocks and wars. upturn was seen from 1980s onwards and finally in 1990s ,following the Economic Reform package.

POLICY FRAMEWORK DURING LIBERALIZATION ERA

Industrial Licensing

Licensing was abolished except for certain defence and strategic industries.
Licenses not needed for capacity expansion as well.
Thus areas reserved for public sector exclusively were reduced from 18 to 3.
MRTP was kept alive (repealed and replaced in 2002 by Competition Act) but the focus is on increasing competition. Threshold limits were abolished. Pre-approvals are no longer required. The CCI only checks monopolistic behavior and scrutinizes mergers.

Foreign and Trade

Automatic FDI approvals with varying participation rates
Foreign Investment Promotion Board FIPB constituted to scrutinize FDI in other areas.
Managed Floating Rate currency Which led to Led to about20% devaluation
replacement of Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA), 1973 with Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA) reduced restriction on foreign exchange.
Public Sector

Disinvestment policy was adopted. Listing to bring about discipline and buybacks also allowed.( areas reserved for public sector exclusively were reduced from 18 to 5 and subsequently to 3.)
Sick industries to be referred to BIFR(Board for industrial & financial reconstruction)
Focus will be on strategic, high-tech sectors where monopoly would be preserved
Banking

Floor limits on SLR reduced from 38% to 25% to reduce financial repression on the asset side
Private banks since 1990
SARFAESI

Basic characteristics of Indian industries in the present times
Traditional Belief is that As an Economy grows, share of Agriculture Declines and The share of Industry increases significantly with a modest rise in services.after this stage is fully entrenched , only later does a transition to the services takes place(KUZNETS and Chenery Research during 1950s- 60s)

Indian Experience is an outlier. Services and Industry both grew almost equally till the late 80s.Since then, Services has taken off and industry share has remained constant. This has created a Situation of IDEOSYNCRATIC growth Where we are still poor, but a tertiarised economy.Due to the skill intensive nature of services india is at the same time a Negative Outlier in terms of Employment in Services

Further, Growth leaders in service sector have been Modern services – Business Services ( 20%), Communication, Financial Services. Software service exports accounted for about 50 % of exports in 2011.

Due to rigid labor laws, land acquisition laws, higer cost of tax compliance, Lower growth in Indian Infrastructure sector in the 90s, low ease of doing business growth of private sector in industry remained limited. Thus share of industries remain same in nation income.

On other hand service sector is less labor and land intensive sector thus growth of this sector increased significantly (Reduces compliance cost for labor laws). At the same time USA was seeing boom in IT sector. Combine it with LPG reforms, service sector got opportunities to exploit its competitiveness to increase export.

Measures taken in recent times to increase the industrial growth in the country
Legal measures

FOR MSME

Government changed the definition of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) as part of the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (self-reliant India) economic relief package. Under the new definition, the distinction between manufacturing and services enterprises has been eliminated. Under the new definition of MSMEs, the investment criteria for such enterprises have been revised upwards, while an additional criterion of turnover has been introduced.

Benefits

Enhances ease of doing business
aligned to new GST regime
information asymmetry corrected as firms under input tax credit GST regime has incentive to file taxes and thus turnover cant be hidden. reduces monitoring costs.
Aligned with global standards
FOR MINING

Removal of distinction between captive and non-captive mines to allow transfer of mining leases and saleof surplus unused minerals. This will lead to improved efficiency in both mining and production.

Incentives

Global tenders to be disallowed up to Rs. 200 crores crores FOR MSMEs
Use of Fintech is being encouraged to enhance transaction based lending using the data(generated by the e-marketplace.( Fintech refers to computer programs and other technology used to support or enable banking and financial services.)
Credit

Under atmanirbhar scgheme

Quicken payment dues to MSMEs within 45 days
Subordinate ddebt for MSME (20000cr) to support stressed MSME having NPAs
Equity funding through FOF(fund of fund) worth Rs 50000cr
Others

MUDRA
TReDS
Infra

National Infrastructure Pipeline
FOR MSME
SFURTI – Traditional Industries Infra

Cluster Development Program ® 50 such clusters have been set up

Technology

ASPIRE A Scheme for Promoting Innovation and Rural Entrepreneurs
