## Indian agriculture at the time of independence

India’s economy under the British colonial rule remained fundamentally agrarian — about 85 per cent of the country’s population lived mostly in villages and derived livelihood directly or indirectly from agriculture. Agriculture and allied  activities  contributed  nearly  50  percent to  India’s  national  income. However, despite being the occupation of such a large population, the agricultural sector continued to experience stagnation and, not infrequently, unusual deterioration.

Agricultural productivity became low though, in absolute terms, the sector experienced some growth due to the expansion of the aggregate area under cultivation. This stagnation in the agricultural sector was caused mainly because of the various systems of land settlement that were introduced by the colonial government.  Particularly, under the zamindari system which was implemented in the then Bengal Presidency comprising parts of India’s present-day eastern states, the profit accruing out of the agriculture sector went to the zamindars instead of the cultivators. However, a considerable number of zamindars, and not just the colonial government, did nothing to improve the condition of agriculture. The main interest of the zamindars was only to collect rent regardless of the economic condition of the cultivators; this caused immense misery and social tension among the latter. To a very great extent, the terms of the revenue settlement were also responsible for the zamindars adopting such an attitude; dates for depositing specified sums of revenue were fixed, failing which the zamindars were to lose their rights.

Besides this, low levels of technology, lack of irrigation facilities and negligible use of fertilisers, all added up to aggravate the plight of the farmers and contributed to the dismal level of agricultural productivity.

There was, of course, some evidence of a relatively higher yield of cash crops in certain areas of the country due to commercialisation of agriculture. But this could hardly help farmers in improving their economic condition as, instead of producing food crops, now they were producing cash crops which were to be ultimately used by British industries back home.

Despite some progress made in irrigation, India’s agriculture was starved of investment in terracing, flood-control, drainage and desalinisation of soil. While a small section of farmers changed their cropping pattern from food crops to commercial crops, a large section of tenants, small farmers and sharecroppers neither had resources and technology nor had incentive to invest in agriculure.

**Above points can be summarized as :-**

**State of Indian agriculture at time of Independence :-**

- **Outdated Technology.**
  1.  - Old technique of production was used.
      - Inefficient use of fertilizers.

In  1950-51,  there  were only  7  tractors,  62  oil  engines  and  16  irrigation  pump-sets  per  lakh hectares  of  gross  cropped  areas  of  the  country.  A  very  negligible amount  of  fertilizer  (0.66  lakh  tonnes  in  1952-53)  was  also  applied on  agriculture.

- **Dependence on Rainfall.**
- - Agriculture was excessively dependent on monsoon rainfall.
- **Low level of Production.**
- - Output per hector was extremely low.
- **Subsistence Farming.**
- - Primary objective for a person was to produce for his own family only.
- **Wedge between owners and tillers of the soil.**
- - Owners never shared proper information with tillers regarding cost of output.

**Causes of Stagnation of Indian Agriculture Sector:**

- **Land revenue system imposed by Britishers ruined Indian agriculture – these policies put heavy rent burden on the peasants.**
- - Zamindari system
  - Mahalwari system
  - Ryotwari system
- **Commercialization of agriculture.**
- - Production was not for self-profit moto for farmers, instead cultivation was done to be sold in British market (e.g.: Indigo).
- **Partition of country.**
- - Food crises in India.
  - Rice food producing area went in Partition to the new formed country Pakistan.
  - The agriculture land distribution was uneven which leaded to shortage of raw resources in various industries.

## Land reforms

Land reforms in India started immediately after Independence with dual objective of effective utilization of land and social justice. The system of Zamindari and feudal system had left farmers landless. To end these sufferings of farmers, land reform movement was advocated by many activists like **Vinoba Bhave** through his **‘Bhoodan’** Movement.

Land is the basis of all economic activities and for agrian society like India it was at most important for further progress. Indian rural Society is symbolized by rich landowning minority (landowners/zamindars) and an impoverished (peasants) land less majority.

**Therefore, Land reform was vital step.**

Immediately after Independence a Committee, under the Chairmanship of the late Shri J. C. Kumarappa (a senior Congress leader), was appointed to look into the problem of land. The Kumarappa Committee’s report recommended comprehensive agrarian reform measures. India’s land policy in the decades immediately following its independence was dominated by legislative efforts to address the problems identified by the Kumarappa Committee. A substantial volume of legislation was adopted, much of it flawed and little of it seriously implemented.

**Several important issues confronted the policy-makers.**

- Land was concentrated in the hands of a few and there was a proliferation of intermediaries who had no vested interest in self-cultivation. Leasing out land was a common practice.
- The tenancy contracts were expropriative in nature and tenant exploitation was ubiquitous.
- Land records were in extremely bad shape giving rise to a mass of litigation. It is ironic that the Supreme Court of India in 1989 commented that the revenue records are not legal documents of title (Wadhwa, 1989). This is a sad commentary on the land records of the country.

It is against this background that land policy has been shaped in India. While land-reform legislation remained active, land policies in more recent decades have focused less on land reform and more on land development and administration.

**Land policy in India has undergone broadly four phases since Independence.**

- The first and longest phase (1950 – 72) consisted of land reforms that included three major efforts:
  - Abolition of the intermediaries,
  - Tenancy reform, and
  - The redistribution of land using land ceilings.

The abolition of intermediaries was relatively successful, but tenancy reform and land ceilings met with less success.

- The second phase (1972 – 85) shifted attention to bringing uncultivated land under cultivation.
- The third phase (1985 – 95) increased attention towards water and soil conservation through the
  - Watershed Development, Drought-Prone Area Development (DPAP) and
  - Desert-Area Development Programmes (DADP).
  - A central government Waste land Development Agency was established to focus on wasteland and degraded land.

**Some of the land policy from this phase continued beyond its final year.**

- The fourth and current phase of policy (1995 onwards) centres on debates about the necessity to continue with land legislation and efforts to improve land revenue administration and, in particular, clarity in land records.

In the earlier phases of land reforms the emphasis was on food production, extending technology and abolishing regressive institutions; poverty as an issue was not explicitly addressed.

**Raj Krishna (1961) grouped land-reform measures into four groups:**

- **Liberative**, measures – it aimed at the emancipation of the actual tillers of the land from the yoke of the landlord. This was to be achieved by conferring the land title or occupancy rights of the tenant. Fixing of rent was undertaken in a few states, e.g. West Bengal’s “Operation Barga”, where tenancy was recorded.
- **Distributive**, – these were meant to achieve this by delivering material resources to the poor as promised by the Constitution of India, especially those who required land as a productive resource. This was to be achieved by redistributing landownership from large landholders to the landless, specifically from socially weaker sections.
- **Organizational** – they aimed at selecting and implementing a particular form of agricultural production practice, with the help of technological change, were introduced in the mid-1960s. These three policies operating together put pressure on land resources, prompting a need for developmental reform.
- Developmental reforms encompassed other issues interconnected with land policy, which impacted the overall development of the agricultural sector.

All four components taken together form a part of the overall distributive and development initiatives that were taken immediately after Independence.

**Immediately after Independence, four important components of land reform were thought of as major policy interventions in building the land policy. These included:**

- - The abolition of intermediaries;
  - Tenancy reforms;
  - Fixing ceilings on land holdings;
  - Consolidation of landholdings.

Zamindari  Abolition  Acts Initially,  when  these  acts  were  passed  in  various  states,  they  were  challenged  in  the  courts  as being  against  the  right  to  property  enshrined  in  the  Indian  Constitution.  So,  amendments  were passed  in  the  Parliament  to  legalise  the  abolition  of  landlordism. By  1956,  Zamindari  abolition acts  were  passed  in  many  states.  As  a  result  of  this,  about  30  lakh  tenants  and  share acquired  ownership  rights  over  a  total  of  62  lakh  acres  of  land  all  over  the  country.

Land  Ceilings  Act Land  ceiling  refers  to  fixicroppers ng  a  cap  on  the  size  of  landholding  a  family  or  individual  can  own.  Any surplus  land  is  distributed  among  landless  people  like  tenants,  farmers,  or  agricultural  labourers.

**Tenancy  reforms This  focused  on  three  areas:**

- - Rent  regulation
  - Tenure  security
  - Conferring  ownership  to  tenants

**Shortcomings of the reforms:**

- - More focused towards Rural lands.
  - Exemption of North-East Indian states.
  - Coverage of Backward Classes.
  - Interconnections between demand for agriculture and Non-Agriculture land.

**Recent Government Acts/Polices:**

- - Land Acquisition Act, 2013.
  - Agricultural Land Leasing Act, 2016.
  - National Land Records Modernization Records.
  - Digital India Land Records Modernization Program.

## Indian agriculture under the five year plans

From 1947 to 2017, the Indian economy was premised on the concept of planning. This was carried through the Five-Year Plans, developed, executed, and monitored by the Planning Commission (1951-2014) and the NITI Aayog (2015-2017)

Overcome these shortfalls, the First 5-Year Plan gave a predominant importance to the development of agriculture and irrigation.

**Five Year Plan and Indian Agriculture:**

**Agriculture under First Plan:**

The chief objective of First 5-Year Plan was to restore the disequilibrium created by the Second World War and the Partition. The Partition of the country resulted in a transfer of the fertile wheat areas of the Punjab and rice areas of Bengal to Pakistan. Pakistan also benefited by getting the long-stapled cotton and jute-growing areas. And a relatively much large acreage of the irrigated area.

Overcome these shortfalls, the First 5-Year Plan gave a predominant importance to the development of agriculture and irrigation out of a total actual investment of Rs. 1960 crores made in the first plan. Rs. 601 crores i.e. 31% was allocated for agriculture.

There were two components of agricultural investment In the public sector,

Rs, 291 crores (15%, of the total) was allocated to agriculture & C.D.P. and the balance of Rs. 310 crores (or 16% of total) was the share of irrigation.

It was expected that the index of farm output would increase from about 100 in 1949-50 to 114 in 1955-56.

**The details of the targets of the various agricultural products are given in the following table.**

This table also gives the extent of achievement of the targets at the end of the Plan. The targets were realized in most of the cases, excepting for commercial crops like sugarcane, cotton and jute. The over fulfilment of the target of food production brought about a fall in the prices in the country.

<!-- ![Indian agriculture under the five year plans](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Indian-agriculture-under-the-five-year-plans.jpg) -->

The above referred targets were expected to be achieved through various measures like institutional reforms. Organisational changes, structural changes and technical progress. The realization of targets was due not only to these changes but also the weather gods. As a result of planning.

Nearly 12 lakh acres of land were reclaimed and brought under farming. As many as 14 mn. acres were brought under irrigation. At the same time the Japanese method of rice-cultivation was largely extended. Nearly 40% of the villages were brought under CDP, and NES.

The effects of increase in food production were quite favourable. India became self-sufficient in food grains. The price index for agricultural commodities (1952-53 = 100) came down to 92.8. Thus the increase in farm output during the First Plan helped to end inflation, stabilized the economy and paved the way for a higher rate of development during the second plan.

**Agriculture under Second Plan:**

The over-fulfillment of First 5-Year Plan target of food output made the planners think that the food problem was solved and that the agricultural base was strengthened. Hence, they devoted a relatively less outlay for agriculture 20% of the public outlay (or Rs. 4800 crores) as compared to 33% in the First Plan.

In money terms, however, the outlay in the Second Plan was higher. It was Rs. 1050 crores as compared to only. Rs.758 crores in the First Plan. The targets originally fixed for the Second Plan which were much lower were revised upward and they were given as in the following table. These targets were to be achieved by the same measures as those in the First Plan. The following table gives the actual production at the end of Second Plan.

<!--
![Indian agriculture under the five year plans](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Indian-agriculture-under-the-five-year-plans1.jpg) -->

The actual progress in agricultural front was quite substantial but fell far short of targets fixed earlier, e.g. against 21 mn. acres of additional land to be brought under irrigation, the actual achievement was about 16 mn. acres only.

The consumption of fertilizer increased very slowly. In brief the methods of increased agricultural production did not make as much headway as was originally visualised by the Planning Commission. However the actual output by the end of Second Plan was much more than the actual output of the beginning of the Second Plan. But these was a shortfall in the Production of all commodities except sugar cane and tea.

The Planning Commission has been blamed for all this on the ground that it did not give enough emphasis to agricultural development and instead it turned its attention to the growth of heavy and basic industries. We are of the opinion that such a criticism was not fair to the Planning Commission. It did understand the significance of increased farm output, but it believed that with a smaller outlay, it would be possible to bring about a larger output.

The poor development of agriculture during Second Plan led to a good number of difficulties in the Indian economy. The most important effect was the rise in the price level. During this Plan, the wholesale price index of all commodities increased by 35%.

As a result of rise in farm prices, other commodities also recorded rise in prices. An inflationary situation rapidly appeared. The imports of food grains which were cut during First Plan had to be resumed and precious foreign exchange meant for machinery and other industrial raw materials had to be wasted in importing food grains.

**Agriculture under Third Plan:**

Third 5 year Plan gave a Predominant emphasis to agriculture. One of the major objectives of the Plan was to achieve self-sufficiency in food grains and to increase agricultural production for exports.

It says, in the scheme of development during the Third Plan the first priority necessarily belongs to agriculture. Experience under the first two plans and especially in the second plan has shown that the rate of growth in the agricultural production is one of the main limiting factors in the process of Indian economy.

Agricultural production has therefore, to be increased to the largest extent feasible, and adequate resource have to be provided under the Third Plan for raising the agricultural production. The rural economy has to be diversified and the proportion of the population dependent on agriculture gradually diminished.

There are essential aims if the income and levels of the rural population are to rise steadily and to keep pace with income in other sectors. Both in formulating and implementing programmes for the development of agriculture, the guiding consideration is that whatever is physically practicable should be made financially possible and the potential of each are a should be developed to the possible extent.

With this end in view, the Plan allocated almost 10% of the total public sector outlay of the Plan i.e., Rs. 1310 crores out of Rs. 6300 crores. Actual expenditure worked out to be Rs. 1754 crores.

<!-- ![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Indian-agriculture-under-the-five-year-plans2.jpg) -->

In short, the Third Plan failed on the agricultural front. In contrast to the targeted increase of 30% or 6% per year in food grains a bare 10% or 2% per year was realized: at the same time, the index of food grains prices had short up from 118.4 in 1961-62 to 168.8 in 1965-66. As a consequence of the shortfall in food production food-grains worth Rs. 1.10 crores were imported between 1961-62 and 1965-66. This strained our foreign exchange position still further.

**Agriculture under the Annual Plan:**

The Third 5 Year Plan, consequently the Fourth Plan could not be introduced in April 1966. Instead the Govt. introduced the annual plans for three years-1966 to 1969. During these annual plans actual expenditure on agriculture worked out to be Rs. 1624 crores which was 24% of the total plan investment of 6757 crore rupees.

The three years of the ‘Plan Holiday’ viz. 1966-67 to 1968-69 witnessed the adoption of the new agricultural strategy, which has come to be commonly known.as the green revolution, and is composed of a package, chiefly of four improvements, none of which is wholly effective without the others: improved varieties increased use of fertilizers, improved water supplies and better agricultural practices. With it are also associated increasing mechanisation of agricultural operations and measures of plant protection from pests and diseases

On account of the drought conditions during 1966-67 minor irrigation received a high priority and the programmes were undertaken on an emergency basis. In addition to this, programmes of high-yielding varieties along with the requisite application of chemical fertilizers were undertaken.

A good year of rainfall coupled with efforts to improve production with a new technological resulted in a record food grains production of 95.6 mn. tonnes in 1967-68. Although the targets for 1968-69 was 102 mn. tonnes, it was not possible to reach the target in view of the crop failure in some regions in India. However the production of food grains. was maintained at the level of 95.6 mn. tonnes in 1968-69. The consumption of chemical fertilizers also touched the level of 1750 thousand tonnes in 1967-68.

**Agriculture under Fourth Plan:**

The bitter experience of the Third Plan made the Planning Commission realize the fact that planning would be a failure unless agricultural production was increased rapidly. Accordingly Planning Commission assigned a high priority to agriculture.

Even in the case of industries, the Planning Commission emphasised those industries which supply fertilizers, agricultural machinery etc. The approach to Fourth Plan emphasised the need of creating favourable economic conditions for the formation of agriculture, a systematic effort to extend the application of science and technology to agriculture and in general intensify agricultural programmes to the maximum possible extent in selected areas.

**The Fourth Plan had the following two main objectives in the agricultural sector:**

- To provide the conditions necessary for a sustained increase of about 5 per cent per annum over the next decade.
- To enable as large a sector of the rural population as possible, including the small farmer, the farmer in dry areas and agricultural labourers to participate in development and share its benefits.

The strategy of agricultural development was based largely on the further extension of the high yielding varieties (HYV) and multiple cropping programmes.

The Fourth Plan envisaged an expenditure of Rs. 3814 crores on Agriculture which was 24% of the total expenditure of Rs 15902 crores. But the actual outlay was less.

The Fourth Plan postulated an annual growth rate of 5% for agriculture as a whole. The compound growth rate target for food’ grains worked out to be 5.6% p.a. Frankly speaking none of the targets fixed in the Fourth Plan was realised.

The target for food grains was 129 mn. tones for 1973-74, but the actual production in that year was only 103 mn. tonnes. The target for what was attained easily-intact, it was exceeded in 1971-72 when wheat output was 26 mn. tonnes as against the target of 24 mn. tonnes for the final year of the Plan.

As against the target of 15 mn. tonnes in 1973-74,. the actual production of pulses in that year was only 98 mn. tonnes. In rice against the target of 52 mn. tonnes, the actual production was 43.7 mn. tonnes. In important commercial crops like cotton and jute actual production was much below the target level.

As against the target of 80 lakh bales the actual production of cotton in 1973-74 was only 38 lakh bales. In jute as against a target of 74 lakh bales, actual production was only the order of 62 lakh bales in 1973-74. With respect to oilseeds and sugarcane too the progress was below expectation.

**Two factors were responsible for better production in wheat:**

- - Area sown under wheat grew by 10 8% and
  - As a result of green revolution, productivity per acre also showed a considerable improvement under high- yielding varieties with a higher consumption of fertilizers.

Taking an overall view the achievements in agriculture.in Fourth Plan showed substantial shortfall compared with the targets laid in the Plan.

**Two major factors besides several others, were responsible for this:**

- It was hoped that consumption of fertilizers would reach a target of 55 lakh tonnes in 1973-74 from an assumed base level of 16.5 lakh tonnes in 1968-69. Actual production of fertilizers was estimated at only 30 lakh tonne in 1973-74. Failure to increase fertilizer production in view of raw materials like naphtha and non-availability of fertilizers in international market were responsible for the shortfall in this area.
- The targets of irrigation could not be fulfilled. In view of the rising costs, although the financial expenditure exceeded targeted provision, the physical achievements in terms of additional irrigated areas got reduced. Thus the Target of food self-sufficiency receded further and the country was forced to import 3.6 m. tonnes of food-grains in 1973 and 48 mn. tonnes in 1974.,

The overall rate of growth of agricultural production during Fourth Plan was only 2’8% p.a. In a number of crops, the growth of output had fallen short of the growth of population, leading to a decline in the per capita availability of essential wage good. The unsatisfactory performance of the agricultural sector was the root cause of the stagnation of national income and inflationary pressures since 1972-73.

**Agriculture under the Fifth Plan:**

During the Fifth Plan, Rs. 7,411. crores will be spent on the development of agriculture and irrigation which accounts for 20% of the total Plan outlay. Beside this, investments by the private sector shall be of the order of Rs. 2,950 crores.

Taking public and private, sectors, together, total outlay on agriculture, will be of the order of Rs. 10,361 crores. With this level of outlay, the Fifth Plan has targeted a growth rate of 4.2% for food-grains as a whole. This is distinctly, less ambitions as than the target set out in the Fourth Plan.

**In determining targets the Fifth Plan has clearly stated its objectives:**

“It is envisaged that the fulfillment, of these targets will make country not only self-sufficient in respect of food grains but also leave a cushion for building a buffer stock. The dimension of growth in commercial crops envisaged in the Plan are such as to take care of export requirement in addition to meet the indigenous needs by way of industrial raw material.” In other words, the objective is food self-sufficiency and self-reliance.”

**Agricultural Development under Sixth Five Year Plan:**

The Sixth Five Year Plan (1980-85) was started in an extremely different circumstances as the year of 1979-80 witnessed a worse drought. It affected agricultural production adversely. However, the achievements of the plan were satisfactory.

**Agricultural Production:**

Among the different crops, only wheat has been keeping pace with the plan targets. The production of rice came close to the target of 55 million tons in 1980-81 but failed to show any improvement in the following years. Kharif crop also suffered a setback due to drought weather in many parts of the country during 1982-83. The total production of all food grains in the terminal year of sixth plan was recorded 138.1 million tons. Out of it, the production of rice and wheat was about 54.5 and 41.2 million Ions, respectively.

Similarly, oilseeds production was 11.4 million tons against as target of 12.5 million tons. Millet production has moved nearer to the target in 1984-85. Table 29.8 shows the trends of agricultural production ending 1984-85. Similarly ,indeed number for the same period exhibits the agricultural production has been highlighted in table.

**Inputs and Other Supporting Programmes:**

Weather conditions were favourable during 1978-79 and 1981-82 which enabled the farmers to make better use of inputs and infrastructure resulting in bumper harvest. This period can specifically be considered as a turning point in Indian agriculture as it could stand a challenge to natural calamities with comparatively less damage.

The plan has set a target of additional irrigation of 5.6 million hectares from major and medium and 8 million hectares from minor schemes. The utilisation potential for major/medium and minor schemes of irrigation was 60.58 million hectares in 1984-85 against 54.1 million hectors in 1980-81. Under the 20-Point Programme, the target was raised to 14.00 million hectares against 13.6 million hectares.

The achievement in the first three years is 6.22 million hectares. By 1981-82, an area of 46.5 million hectares was brought under high yielding varieties, which increased to 54.1 million hectares in 1984-85. Chemical fertilizer obtained anticipated achievement in 1982-83 of 60.64 lac tons against the target of 46.50 lac tons. The consumption of fertilizer during 1981-82 was 60.6 lac tons which increased to 82.2 lac tons in 1984-85.

For the development of dry farming during 1982-83.3824 micro watersheds covering 3.8 million hectares were to be identified by various states. It had covered 4111 micro-watersheds against the total target of 3824 watersheds by the end of March 1983. Upto July 1983, 43.31 lac acres of land had been declared surplus under the revised land ceiling laws. 29.45 lac acres have been taken over by the states and out of this 20.05 lac acres have been distributed among 14.82 lac eligible families of landless agricultural workers. The consumption of plant protection materials was below expectations i.e. actual consumption in 1984-85 was only 56000 tons.

**Minikits and Other Programmnes:**

The central sector scheme of community nurseries of rice and minikit distributions of rice, wheat, jowar, bajra, maize and rabi were intensified in order to create a visible impact on production of cereal crops. The physical target of coverage of area under the community nurseries of rice was raised from 15000 hectare to 25000 hectares during 1982-83.1.42 lac minikits were distributed during 1982-83 against 14000 minikits during 1981-82.

**Agricultural marketing and Rural Godowns:**

In 1982-83, 40 selected regulated markets, 2 terminal markets. 350 primary rural markets in rural area and 20 wholesale markets in backward area have been provided the central assistance for the development of infrastructural facilities. 2371 godowns having a storage capacity of 10.65 lac tons were sanctioned upto 1981-82. In 1982-83, 4 lac tons capacity of additional target was expected to have been achieved.

**Agricultural Credit:**

The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) was set up in July 1982. As on 30th June 1981, there were 27 State Cooperative Banks, 327 Central Cooperative Banks, 94019. Primary Agricultural Credit Societies and 19 State Land Development Banks with 1731 Primary Land Development Banks. The Commercial Banks had 17658 rural and 8370 semi urban branches in the country. The total credit under multi-agency was recorded to be Rs.5556 crores in 1984-85.

**Agricultural Development in Seventh Plan:**

The outlay for agriculture and allied sector including forestry and wild life was Rs. 10524 crore in Seventh Plan against Rs.6440 crores in Sixth Five Year Plan Period. The average level of annual production of food grains during the plan period was around 155 millions tonnes. In 1990-91 food grain production reached to the level of 176-92 million tonnes against the production of 140.35 million tonnes in 1987-88.

Wheat production has increased to 2244 Kg/ha in 1989-90 while the production of cereals reached to the level of 34.76 million tonnes in the same year. The production of pulses and oilseed peaked to the level of 14.06 and 18.46 million tonnes in 1990-91. The production of sugarcane reached a record level of over 240 million tonnes in 1990-91.

The certified seeds distributed were 57.04 lakh quintals ending 1989-90 against the target of 70 lakh quintals. The total consumption of N, P and K was 11.5 million tonnes while pesticides was of 72.47 thousand tonnes ending the plan period. The area under high yielding varieties was 63.1 million hectares against the target of 70.00 million hectares. The production of tea and rubber was increased from 652 million Kgs. and 201000 tonnes in 1984-85 to 703 million Kgs and 297000 tonnes in 1989-90 respectively.

During the plan period, disbursement of agriculture credit through cooperatives commercial and regional rural banks increased from Rs.5810 crores in 1984-85 to Rs. 12570 crores by 1989-90. The debt relief scheme was announced in 1990-91, affected the recovery climate resulting in a lower volume of credit flow.

There were 76,000 fertilizer retailer outlets and 40 lakh tonnes of fertilizer nutrients were distributed during 1989-90. The number of co-operative godown/warehousing capacity increased from 80 lakh tonnes in 1984-85 to 100 lakh tonnes in 1987-88. Soil and water conservation activity in 27 catchments taken up in 17 states covering 2.4 million hectares by the close of plan period.

The contribution of the livestock sector has increased to Rs. 27,700 crores in 1987-88 as compared to Rs. 10,000 crores in 1980-81 which constitutes 25.5 percent of the total agricultural output. By the end of Seventh Plan, 22.75 lakh tonnes of marine and 14.02 lakh tonnes of inland fish were produced, indicating an average annual growth rate 6.25 per cent. However, during 1990-91 export of marine products was 138400 tonnes valued at Rs.8.90 crores while fish production stood at 38.36 lakh tonnes over the same year.

The number of national dairy co-operative societies increased from 34523 in 1984-85 to 64000 in 1991-92. The progress in case of milk, eggs and wool was 41.5 million tonnes; 14252 millions and 3S.0 in. Kgs. in 1984-85 respectively which rose to the level of 51.1 million tonnes 920204 and 41.7 m. Kgs. for milk, eggs and wool ending 1989-90.

**Agricultural Development in the Eighth Plan:**

Eighth Plan envisages to spend Rs. 22,467 crore on agricultural development. For rural development a total sum of Rs. 34,425 crore has been fixed whereas Rs. 6,750 crore on special area programme and Rs. 35,525 crore on irrigation and flood control have been proposed in the draft of the plan.

In this way agricultural sector alone will attract 22.2 percent of the total plan expenditure. Self-sufficiency in food grains and development and diversification of agriculture to generate export surplus are the main objects of the plan. Apart from this, plan emphasises to increase food grains production to 2100 lakh tonnes, of sugarcane to 2,750 lakh tonnes, of cotton 140 lakh bales and of jute to 95 lakh bales.

Eighth Five Year Plan envisages to continue work on 312 medium and 182 major projects initiated during the seventh plan. The draft of the plan emphasizes to make Command Area Development Programme more effective. In the draft of the plan, medium irrigation projects were accorded high priority. Flood control programmes will be made more meaningful. Thus, in Eighth Plan, a sum of Rs. 35,525 crore have been proposed on irrigation development and flood control measures.

In the agricultural sector, the country has achieved 5 per cent rate in 1992-93 and 2.3 per cent growth rate in 1993-94. Total production of food grains has increased to 179.5 million tonnes in 1992-93 showing a growth rate of 6.6 per cent and then it slightly increased to 184.0 million tonnes in 1993-94 showing a growth rate of 1.4 per cent and further 199.0 million tonnes in 1996-97. Thus the agricultural sector both in respect of food grains and fibre crops has registered almost a stagnation during the first two years of the Eighth Plan.

In 1994-95, production of food grains has increased to 191 million tonnes which shows a growth of only 3.7 per cent. Thus the new economic policy could not create any favourable impact on the performance of the agricultural sector of the country. The potential of irrigation increased from 728 lakh hectares to 894 lakh. The achievements of agricultural sector during the first four years of eighth plan were presented in the following table.

<!-- ![Indian agriculture under the five year plans](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Indian-agriculture-under-the-five-year-plans4.jpg) -->

The agricultural development strategy during Ninth Five Year Plan is based on the Policy of food security announced by the Government to double the production and make India hunger free in ten years.

Accordingly the Ninth Plan target is to achieve a growth rate of about 4.5 per cent per annum in agricultural output and production of 234 million tonnes of food grains by 2001-02. In order to achieve the goal of doubling the food output and alleviation of hunger, a regionally differentiated strategy based on agro-climatic regional planning will be adopted.

Agro-climatic based planning is to be promoted for high productivity zone, low productivity-high potential zone, low productivity zone and ecologically fragile regions. The table below presents the targets of production for agricultural commodities for 2001-02. Plan emphasised on raising the capabilities of small and marginal fanners and conserving and maximising the value from scarce natural resources. Emphasis was laid on infrastructure development and minor irrigation.

Regional programmes was formulated particularly for hilly backward and tribal areas. Agricultural credit got special attention and efforts were made to increase public investment during the plan period. In every district rural infrastructure development fund was used to promote productive projects.

A high emphasis was placed given for the development of the allied sectors such as horticulture, fisheries, live-stock and dairy. Agricultural exports will receive special attention and the co-operative will be strengthened.

It has also been emphasised that agro-processing and agro-industries will be encouraged. The consumption of fertilizers (NPK) during 1996-97 was 14.31 million tonnes, during the Ninth Five Year Plan greater use of Bio-fertilizers and bio- technological research will be encouraged. However, targets of production is given in table

<!-- ![Indian agriculture under the five year plans](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Indian-agriculture-under-the-five-year-plans5.jpg) -->

Agriculture and allied sector has attained 2.7 per cent growth rate against its target of 3.9 per cent. The same sector attained the growth rate of (-) 2.4 per cent in 1997-98,7.1 per cent in 1998-99 and a mere 0.7 per cent in 1999-2000 and 0.9 per cent in 2000-2001.

The index of agricultural production (1981- 82=100) increased from 165.3 in 1997-98 to 178.1 in 1998-99 and then declined to 176.8 in 1999-2000 and 170.6 in 2000-2001. Total production of food grains has also increased substantially from 192.3 million tonnes in 1997-98 to 203.5 million tonnes in 1998-99 and then to 208.9 million tonnes in 1999-2000. It, further declined to 199.0 million tonnes in 2000-01. Thus, the agriculture and allied sector has shown a mixed performance during the Plan period of Ninth Five Year Plan.

**Agricultural Development in the Tenth Plan:**

Although the draft Tenth Plan had set a target to attain annual average growth rate of 3.97 per cent in Agriculture and allied sector, but during the Tenth Plan it has attained (-) 7.2 per cent in 2002-03 and then to 10 per cent in 2003-04 and 6.0 per cent in 2005-06 and is expected to attain only 2.7 per cent in 2006-07.

Total production of food grains increased from 179.4 million tonnes in 2002-03 to 212.4 million tonnes in 2003-04 and then to 208.3 (P) million tonnes in 2006-07. The index of agricultural production in 1981-82 = 100) increased from 150.4 in 2002-03 to 181.0 in 2003-04 and then to 197.1 in 2006- 07. Thus the agriculture and allied sector has been showing a mixed performance.

**Agricultural Development in 11th Plan:**

Although the agricultural sector of the country is having a great potential but the growth rate of the sector is very low. The greatest challenge before the Eleventh Plan is to double the growth rate of agriculture so achieved in the Tenth Plan. This will require steps both on the demand side as well as the supply side.

On the demand side there is evidence that farmers face adverse demand conditions. Not only the agricultural growth has been low in the last decade but the prices received for the agricultural products have also failed to keep pace with the costs or the general price level and as a result profitability of the sector has declined.

The Approach Paper of the Eleventh Plan is of the view that some of the steps already taken such as introduction of National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme (NREGP) along with expansion of public sector schools and health facilities would directly and indirectly generate demand support for agriculture.

Moreover, improved rural connectivity envisaged through Bharat Nirman can also trigger growth of an integrated national market where rural areas are more able to meet each other’s demand.

Such expanded rural—rural trade is likely to be important in the initial years along with other efforts of demand support such as promoting agricultural exports, for strengthening support to agricultural diversification for domestic processing which are likely to attract private corporate investment into rural areas.

The supply side challenge of doubling agricultural growth is also formidable. This is mainly because no dramatic technological breakthrough comparable to the green revolution is presently visible. We are also not initiating or exploiting the potential of existing technology. In fact, most of the growth required in cereals, pulses and oilseeds is possible merely through plausible yield increase in currently low yield regions untouched by green revolution.

The National Commission on Farmers has also drawn attention to the knowledge deficit which constrains agricultural productivity. In order to overcome this problem farmer will need effective links to universities and best practices through a good extension system. The problem of lack of credit facilities needs to be addressed.

Accelerated agricultural growth will require diversification into horticulture and floriculture, effective marketing linkages supported by modern marketing practices adopted through grading post- harvest management, cold-chains, etc. to be established for expanding domestic market and also the export market.

There is also the need for risk management through expansion of crop insurance. The government must devise the viable policy packages to cover all agro-climatic zones. There is also the need for stimulating agricultural research to address the newer and more formidable challenges. The contract farming is a potentially effective way of attracting corporate investors to help establish linkages with markets and also provide farmers with necessary inputs, extension and other support and advice.

Moreover, there is also need for better water management and effective irrigation facilities. Watershed management, rainwater harvesting and ground water recharge can also help in augmenting water availability in rainfed areas. Side by side there is also the need for developing animal husbandry and fishery activities to revive agricultural dynamism.

However, there is urgent need for taking agriculture into a higher growth trajectory of 4 per cent annual growth and such target can only be met with improvement in the scale as well as of quality of agricultural reforms undertaken by the various states and agencies at the various levels.

These reforms must aim at efficient use of resources and conservation of soil, water and ecology on a sustainable basis and in holistic framework which must incorporate financing of rural infrastructure such as water, roads and power.

**The approach paper to the Eleventh Plan has aptly highlighted such holistic framework and suggested the following strategy to raise agricultural output:**

- Doubling the rate of growth of irrigated area;
- Improving water management, rain water harvesting and watershed development;
- Reclaiming degraded land and focusing on soil quality;
- Bridging the knowledge gap through effective extension;
- Diversifying into high value outputs, fruits, vegetables, flowers,, herbs and spices, medicinal plants, bamboo, bio-diesel. but with adequate measures to ensure food security;
- Promoting animal husbandry and fishery;
- Providing easy access to credit at affordable rales;
- Improving the incentive structure and functioning of market, if necessary, through state intervention for improving the prices of agricultural produce and
- Refocusing on land reforms issues. National Commission on Farmers has already laid the foundation for such a framework.

Moreover, R&D expenditure on agriculture in India is low by international standards, despite its high social return. Increased R&D expenditure backed by modern technologies and compatible institutions must be focused in the coming years.

With proper implementation, the National Agricultural Innovation Project initiated in July, 2006 for enhancing livelihood security in partnership mode with farmer’s groups panchayati raj institutions and private sector would go a long way in strengthening basic and strategic research in frontier agricultural lances.

**Criticism of Agricultural Planning in India:**

- **Self-Complacency:**

The First 5-Year Plan wisely gave a top priority agriculture But the Second 5-Year Plan failed to give agriculture a proper place. It appears, the success of the First 5-year Plan, which was primarily due to a series of favourable Monsoons created a sense of self-complacency.

- **Quick-Yielding Projects Not given Sufficient Importance:**

Projects having a long gestation period were given undue importance and those with a short fruition lag were not given sufficient importance. Minor irrigation works did not receive the attention they deserved. More attention was given to expansion of irrigation potential and less to maintenance of existing works so that increase in irrigation potential was neutralized by loss of irrigation potential.

- **Unproductive Expenditure:**

Unnecessarily large sums were provided for unproductive expenditure.

- **Inadequate Provision for Rural Credit:**

The annual credit requirements of the Indian farmers have been estimated at Rs. 10, 000-12,000 mn. whereas the provision is not even for Rs. 3500 mn. Without adequate credit facilities agriculture cannot progress.

- **No Provision for Agricultural Inputs:**

There has had been co-ordinated provision for the simultaneous production of agricultural inputs like fertilizers, pesticides, cement, etc.

- **New Farming Techniques Not Enforced:**

In agricultural planning in India, no concrete steps were taken for the adoption of new agricultural technique and for standardizing farming practices.

- **Lack of Suitable Price Policy:**

Unless farm output programmes are backed by a suitable agricultural price policy providing price support and incentives to the growers, things might go wrong and they have actually gone wrong in India.

- **Morale Neglected:**

India is passing through a crisis of confidence. The planners did not provide for any concrete measure to keep up the morale of the people.

- **Unrealistic Planning:**

The failure to achieve targets indicates the unrealistic element in agricultural planning in India. The physical targets have proved ,to be “paper targets” treating irrigated area from all sources alike and to put all types of food grains superior and inferior together and above all to split up minutely the total allotment: under, different headings assigned to different authorities, are a few, instances of unrealistic planning

- **Delay in Land Reforms:**

Land reforms have not been implemented and whichever implemented have been delayed much.

## Food security in India

According to UN-India, there are nearly 195 million undernourished people in India, which is a quarter of the world’s hunger burden.

Roughly 43% of children in India are chronically undernourished.

People Below Poverty Line in India decreased to around 22% in 2011-12. The Poverty percentage was calculated using the Tendulkar methodology.

According to Global Hunger Index, 2020, India rank has improved to 94th position out of the 107 countries but much behind countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal.

**What is Food Security?**

Food security is when all people at all times have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.

Food security in India is a major challenge and there are several aspects to it. With an ever-growing population and decreasing productive land, food security is even harder to achieve than before. The foremost challenge to food security in India is the unpredictable weather situation

In order to achieve food security in equitable manner to all the citizens of India, Parliament enacted **Food Security Act, 2013**. It is responsible to provide food security at rate of 75% in rural and 50% in Urban areas.

Antyodaya Yojana and Priority householders are the main beneficiaries of these act. **The Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution** is the nodal ministry for the implementation of food subsidy. Allocation to this Ministry accounts for 7% of the budget of the central government in 2021-22.

**Silent features of Food Security act, 2013 are:**

- Foodgrains are distributed at subsidized rates.
- Targeted Public Distribution System.
- Food Security Allowance.
- Transparency provisions are made available to avoid loop holes.

**Significance of Act:**

1.  To boost the Agriculture sector.
2.  Aids the Government to Regulate the Prices.
3.  Enhance reduction in poverty.
4.  Access to nutritious food.
5.  Also important for global security and national stability.

**Food Security Programs in India:**

1.  Public Distribution System.
2.  Mid-day Meal Scheme.
3.  Integrated Child Development Services scheme.
4.  Mega Food Parks.
5.  Sampada Yojana.

**Challenges in achieving Food Security:**

- Implementing measures to improve agricultural productivity and food storage

The government policy needs to adopt an integrated policy framework to facilitate the increased use of irrigation and newer farming techniques. The measures should focus mainly on rationale distribution of cultivable land, improving the size of the farms and providing security to the tenant cultivators apart from providing the farmers with improved technology for cultivation and improved inputs like irrigation facilities, availability of better quality seeds, fertilizers and credits at lower interest rates. One main reason why food is not distributed equitably is that a significant amount is wasted.

It would be useful to adopt strategies for food storage which have been implemented successfully in other countries.

- Ensuring food availability and accessibility to below poverty line (BPL) candidates

This can be done by more accurate targeting of the BPL population so that they get food at substantially low price. There is a problem associated with the identification of BPL. There is a debate about the exact number of people falling under this category. Besides helping out the BPL population, there should be a provision for subsidy on the sale of food grains to above poverty line (APL) customers too. Also, all restrictions on food grains regarding inter-State movement, stocking, exports and trade financing should be removed. This will reduce the food prices and increase affordability. The Public Distribution System must be made transparent and reliable.

- Improving purchasing power through employment generating schemes

The government should come up with more holistic schemes like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). Poverty alleviation programmes like the Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP) and employment generation schemes like Jawahar Rozgar Yojana, Nehru Rozgar Yojana etc need to be re-oriented and up scaled to make a positive impact on the purchasing power of the lower socio-economic segment of the population. Also, it is equally important to enhance the quantity and quality of wage-paid employment. Focus needs to be shifted to the workers in the informal sector by providing decent wages and healthy working conditions. In the urban areas, providing assistance to the small scale enterprises will lead to expansion of employment opportunities. It should be ensured that nutritional objectives should be an integral part of all the poverty alleviation programmes.

- Crop diversification, establishing food grain banks and promoting household gardening

Another area which needs to be explored is ‘crop diversification’. Higher profitability and the stability in production highlight the importance of crop diversification, e.g. legumes alternative with rice and wheat. Growing of non-cereal crops such as oilseeds, fruits and vegetables etc need to be encouraged. The creation of decentralized food grain banks in each village or block of the district, from which people may get subsidized food grains against food coupons, will be a good option. This concept will improve the delivery of food grains and eliminate corruption.

One of the ways to ensure direct access to good quality food that can be easily grown and prepared could be the concept of home gardening.

- Community awareness through IEC activities and social marketing

Need based IEC and training materials should be developed for effective dissemination of nutrition messages. Local community education on key family health and nutrition practices using participatory and planned communication methodologies will be helpful. Incorporating health and nutrition education into formal school curriculum for girls and adult literacy programmes could greatly improve women’s health and nutrition. Social marketing of iodized salt, iron and folic acid and vitamin A supplements, nutritious food mixes and other low cost vitamin/mineral preparations will prove to be beneficial.

- Monitoring and timely evaluation of nutritional programmes

A complete community based approach needs to be adopted. Focus on even simple interventions like promoting exclusive breastfeeding, proper complementary feeding and growth monitoring and promotion (GMP) can be expected to give outstanding results. Efforts should be made by the concerned health departments and authorities to initiate and supervise the functioning of the nutrition related schemes in an efficient way. Annual surveys and rapid assessments surveys could be some of the ways through which program outcomes can be measured. Evaluations must be timely performed and should provide relevant information regarding the effectiveness of interventions. Use of information technology to improve program monitoring can be thought of too.

- Community participation and intersectoral coordination

Revamping of existing direct nutrition programmes to enable management by women’s Self Help Groups (SHGs) and /or local bodies along with orientation and training of community health workers, Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI) members, other opinion leaders, care givers and other stakeholders can be another area, if addressed, can give positive results. Delivering very basic, well-targeted package of nutrition services through a multi-sectorial approach will improve the nutrition level of people. Attention needs to be given to school based interventions including hygiene, sanitation and nutrition education. Community based nutrition programs (CBNP) which create scope for community participation, must be facilitated by effective policy implementation.

- Ethical Considerations

Ethical issue principles including plagiarism, informed consent, misconduct, data fabrication and/or falsification, double publication and/or submission, redundancy, etc. have been completely observed by the authors.

**Solutions:**

- - Enhance food storage capacities like cold chain technology.
  - Increase Irrigation.
  - Fertilizer availability.
  - Focus should be kept on employment provisions through various sectors.
  - Community Participation.
  - Crop Diversification.
  - Enhance Renewable Energy generation speedily.

**Department of Food and Public Distribution:**

A department integral to the well-being of the citizens of a country, the department of food and public distribution works for the timely and efficient availability of food for every individual.

**Functions of the department are:**

- - To ensure food security of India through continuous procurement and distribution of food.
  - To provide the proper value of grains to the farmers.
  - To devise policies on import and export of food, sugar and edible oils.

**International Organizations for food security:**

**Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO):**

FAO was established as a specialized agency of the United Nations in 1945 with the objective is to help eliminate hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition.

**World Food Program (WFP):**

WFP was founded in 1963 for tackling food emergencies and initiating programs to combat hunger worldwide.

**International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD):**

Set up in 1977 by United Nations, IFAD focuses on rural poverty reduction, working with poor rural populations in developing countries to eliminate poverty, hunger, and malnutrition.

**World Bank:**

World Bank is one of the oldest international organizations in the world and it was founded in 1944, the World Bank is actively involved in funding food projects and programs.

**United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP):**

It was founded in 1972 as this institute for environmental issues but has been involved in tacking food crisis resulting from environmental issues.

**Revolution for Food Security and Enhancing Production:**

- - Green Revolution – Agriculture Production
  - Pink Revolution – Meat and Poultry Production
  - Red Revolution – Meat & Tomato Production
  - Round Revolution – Potato Revolution
  - Silver Revolution – Egg/Poultry Production
  - White Revolution – Milk/Dairy production
  - Yellow Revolution – Oil Seeds production
  - Blue Revolution – Fish Production
  - Brown Revolution – Leather /Cocoa production
  - Golden Revolution – Horticulture and Honey Production.

## Organization of agricultural credit in India

Agricultural credit is considered as one of the most basic inputs for conducting all agricultural development programs. After independence, the Government adopted the institutional credit approach through various agencies like co-operatives, commercial banks, regional rural banks etc. to provide adequate credit to farmers, at a cheaper rate of interest. Moreover, with growing modernization of agriculture during the post-green revolution period, the requirement of agricultural credit has increased further in recent years

The government has been raising credit target for the farm sector every year, With the aim of doubling farmers’ income by 2022. The agricultural credit flow has increased consistently over the years, exceeding the target set for each fiscal.

Credit is a critical input in achieving higher farm output. Institutional credit will also help delink farmers from non-institutional sources where they are compelled to borrow at usurious rates of interest.

Since Green revolution, the investment requirements for cultivation has continuously increased, as almost all inputs like seeds, pesticides, fertilizers, motor pump sets, tractors, pipe lines, etc., are to be purchased and several other services such as tractors, sprayers, rotors, harvesters etc., are to be hired from the market.

**Types of agricultural credit**

Considering the period and purpose of the credit requirement of the farmers of the country, agricultural credit in India can be classified into three major types:

- **Short term credit:** The Indian farmers require credit to meet their short term needs viz., purchasing seeds, fertilizers, paying wages to hired workers etc. for a period of less than 15 months. Such loans are generally repaid after harvest. The Indian farmers require credit to meet their short term needs viz., purchasing seeds, fertilizers, paying wages to hired workers etc. for a period of less than 15 months. Such loans are generally repaid after harvest and are called short term credit. In fact, the proportion of such loans has been quite high.
- **Medium-term credit:** This type of credit includes credit requirement of farmers for a medium period ranging between 15 months and 5 years and it is required for purchasing cattle, pumping sets, other agricultural implements etc. Medium-term credits are normally larger in size than short term credit.
- **Long term credit**: Farmers also require finance for a long period of more than 5 years just for the purpose of buying additional land or for making any permanent improvement on land like the sinking of wells, reclamation of land, horticulture etc. Thus, the long term credit requires sufficient time for the repayment of such loan.

**Sources Agricultural Credit:**

- Sources of agricultural credit can be broadly classified into institutional and non-institutional sources.
  - - Non-Institutional sources include moneylenders, traders and commission agents, relatives and landlords, but
    - Institutional sources include co-operatives, commercial banks including the SBI Group, RBI and NABARD.
- The major institutional credit agencies in India are Commercial Banks (CBs), Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) which are mainly sponsored by the Scheduled Commercial Banks and state governments. There are also the Cooperative Banks which are further divided into rural cooperatives and urban cooperatives.
- Scheduled Commercial Banks are largest credit providers followed by Cooperatives and Regional Rural Banks. It is observed that after the nationalization of commercial banks of India in 1969, the commercial banks as a whole have increased consistently its share in institutional credit to agriculture sector.

<!-- ![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Organization-of-agricultural-credit-in-India.png) -->

**Government steps for providing Agriculture Credit to Farmers:**

- **Kisan Credit Card (1998-99):**

The Kissan Credit Card (KCC) scheme was launched in 1998 with the aim of providing short-term formal credit to farmers. Owner cultivators, as well as tenant farmers, can avail loans to meet their agricultural needs under this scheme at attractive rates of interest. RBI monitors it for SCBs and NABARD monitors the scheme with respect to Cooperative Banks and RRBs. Now Cooperative sector are under RBI. Budget 2018-19 extended this provision to Animal Husbandry and Fisheries.

- **Agriculture Market Infrastructure Fund (AMIF) – NABARD:**

For development and upgradation of rural agriculture markets. It was announced in 2018 Budget for developing and upgrading agricultural marketing infra in the 22,000 Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs) and 585 APMCs. At present, GrAMs are being developed by MGNREGA Funds. Scheme is demand driven. It will be created with NABARD and will provide the state/ UT governments subsidized loans for their proposal for developing marketing infrastructure in 585 APMCs and 10,000 villages.

- **Interest subvention scheme:**

The Interest Subvention Scheme is being implemented by NABARD and RBI.

The interest subvention scheme for farmers aims at providing short term credit to farmers at the subsidized interest rate.  The policy came into force with effect from Kharif 2006-07. The scheme is being implemented for the year 2018-19 and 2019-20.

- **NABARD Fund of Rupees 700 crore VCF for Rural Agriculture Startups:**

The fund has been launched by Nabventures, a subsidiary of NABARD, and has a proposed corpus of Rs 500 crore with an option to retain over-subscription of Rs 200 crore, called as the greenshoe option (over allotment option).

## Agriculture Marketing and Warehousing

- The price of the produce will be clearly mentioned in the contract.
- A clearly specified dispute resolution protecting the rights of both farmers and buyers.
  ​
  **The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020**
  ​
- - The Central Government may only invoke the provisions of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 in an extraordinary situation (war, famine, extraordinary price rises and natural calamities) - Imposition of stock limits must only be based on price rises -if there is a 100% increase in retail price of horticultural produce and a 50% increase in the retail price of non-perishable produce.
    ​
    Importantly, these bills do not dismantle the existing structure of State APMCs; rather, they provide competition to this system by opening up alternative marketing structures, direct buying, and contract farming. These bills do not replace the prevailing system of public procurement at MSP.
    ​
    **Issues and Problems**
    ​
    The fragmentation and political significance of agricultural supply chains in has a direct impact on their functioning. Though the supply chain system has set in, a number of problems still exist in system implementation.
    ​
- Infrastructure: Infrastructure in India requires significant investment. Grain storage, Cold storage chain, proper Road and Transportation facilities are yet to be implemented in certain states esp. North Eastern Region.
- Government Purchase and supply system: Bureaucracy and corruption are well known problems in India.
- Middleman, Bargaining Power and Transparency
- Price volatility: All of the above factors mentioned, and diverse weather in country is contributing to price volatility. When future prices are difficult to estimate, farmers cannot plan to grow the most efficient or profitable crop.
- Financing, education, and Training.
  ​
  **Solutions:**
  ​
- Package and storing.
- There is a great necessity to increase the shelf life of products by drying, curing and packaging.
- Information management and planning.
- Export enablement.
- Enabling of large private players.

## Agricultural labour

It is one of the primary objects of the Five Year Plan to ensure fuller opportunities for work and better living to all the sections of the rural community and, in particular, to assist agricultural labourers and backward classes to come to the level of the rest. One of the most distinguishing features of the rural economy of India has been the growth in the number of agricultural workers, cultivators and agricultural labours engaged in crop production. The phenomena of underemployment, under-development and surplus population are simultaneously manifested in the daily lives and living of the agricultural workers. Agricultural workers constitute the most neglected class in Indian rural structure. Their income is low and employment irregular. Since, they possess no skill or training, they have no alternative employment opportunities either.

Labour is the most important input in increasing production in traditional agriculture. In the early stage of development, since land was available in plenty increase in labour supply led to the clearing of more land for bringing it under cultivation. Agricultural labourers are socially and economically poorest section of the society. Agricultural labourers households constitute the historically deprived social groups, displaced handicraftsmen and dispossessed peasantry. They are the poorest of the poor in rural India. Their growth reflects the colonial legacy of under development and the inadequacies of planning intervention in the past.

The poverty syndrome among agricultural labourers needs to be read against such a background of prolonged rural under development, assetlessness, unemployment, low wages, under-nutrition, illiteracy and social backwardness constitute the poverty syndrome among agricultural labourers. These reinforce each other so as to constitute a vicious circle of poverty.

**The Indian agriculture, however, has its own characteristics:**

1.  **Subsistent in Character:**

Despite eleven five year plans, in greater parts of the country, Indian agriculture is subsistent in character. The cultivators and farmers grow crops mainly for the family consumption. It is only in the controlled irrigated parts of the country like Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh, and Kaveri delta where agriculture has become an agri-business or is market.

2.  **Heavy Pressure of Population:**

The Indian agriculture is characterized by heavy pressure of population. About 70 per cent of the total population of the country is directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture.

3.  **Predominance of Food Grains:**

In both the Kharif (summer) and the rabi (winter) seasons, grain crops occupy the greater proportion of the cropped area.

4.  **Mixed Cropping:**

In the rain-fed areas of the country, mixed cropping is a common practice. The farmers mix millets, maize and pulses in the kharif season and wheat, gram and barley in the rabi season. In the areas of Jhuming (shifting cultivation), ten to sixteen crops are mixed and sown in the same field.

5.  **High Percentage of the Reporting Area under Cultivation:**

In India, about 55 per cent of the total reporting area is under cultivation of crops and pastures. This is much higher when compared with about 4 per cent in Canada, 12 per cent in China, 15 per cent in Japan.

6.  **Small Size of Holdings and Fragmentation of Fields:**

Over 70 per cent of the holdings are either small or marginal, i.e. less than one hectare. The small size of holdings is mainly due to the law of inheritance and other socio-cultural and economic factors.

Labour policy in India has been evolving in response to the specific needs of the situation in relation to industry and the working class and has to suit the requirements of a planned economy. The legislation and other measures adopted by Government in this field represent the consensus of opinion of the parties vitally concerned and thus acquire the strength and character of a national policy, operating on a voluntary basis.

**The first Agricultural Labour Enquiry Committee of 1950-51** regarded those workers as agricultural workers who normally worked for 50 per cent of more days on the payment of wages.

**The second Agricultural Labour Enquiry Committee, 1956-57** accepted a broad view and included all those workers into agricultural labourers who were badly engaged in agriculture and allied activities like animal husbandry, dairy, piggery, poultry farming etc.

The first committee again classified the agricultural workers into two different categories such as:

- - attached labourers are those workers who are attached to some other farmer households on the basis of a written or oral agreement.
  - landless labourers who exclusively work for others.
  - tenants who work on leased land but work most of the time on the land of others;
  - sharecroppers who also work as agricultural labourers.

**Condition of agricultural labours:**

They remain largely unorganized, and as a result their economic exploitation continues. Their level of income, standard of living and the rate of wages have remained abnormally low.

**Agricultural Wages and Income:**

In India, the agricultural wages are very low. The First Agricultural Labour Enquiry Committee in its report mentioned that the per capita annual income of agricultural labour families was as poor as Rs 104 in 1950-51 and the annual average income of the household was Rs 447.

After the introduction of improved farming methods and mechanization of the level of income of middle and rich farmers increased but at the same time due to fall in the demand for labour real wages declined.

**Employment and Other Working Conditions:**

In India the agricultural labourers are facing severe unemployment and underemployment problem as there is no alternative sources of employment. Although the system of bonded labour is abolished but according to NSS (32 round) about 3.5 lakh **bonded labourers** still exist in India.

**Factors Responsible for the Poor Conditions of Farm Workers:**

**(i) Unorganised:**

Agricultural labourers in India are totally unorganised as they are ignorant, illiterate and widely scattered. Thus, the farm workers have no capacity to bargain for securing a fair wage level.

**(ii) Low Social Status:**

Farm workers mostly belong to depressed classes and thus they are lacking the courage to assert their basic rights.

**(iii) Seasonal Unemployment:**

As the agricultural operations are seasonal thus the farm workers are often facing the problem of seasonal unemployment and under-employment. Farm workers on an average get employment for about 200 days in a year.

**(iv) Absence of Alternative Occupations:**

In the absence of alternative occupation in the rural areas the farm workers are not getting alternative jobs when they suffer from seasonal unemployment.

**(v) Growing Indebtedness:**

Agricultural labourers in India are highly indebted. As the level of wages is very poor thus the farm workers have been borrowing from landlords and become bonded labourers ultimately.

Thus, considering these above factors it can be said that the agricultural labourers in India are living in inhuman conditions and in the absence of organized status they are deprived of all the basic amenities of life.

**Measures Adopted by the Government to Improve the Conditions of Farm Workers:**

In order to improve the conditions of agricultural labourers in India both the central as well as the state Governments have taken various steps since independence. These measures are as follows:

**(i) Abolition of Bonded Labour:**

In order to remove agrarian slavery after independence Indian constitution has undertaken legislative measures to abolish the practice of bonded labour. Accordingly, the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act 1976 was passed and about 2.51 lakh bonded labourers were identified and freed in different parts of the country.

**(ii) Minimum Wages Act:**

In 1948, the Minimum Wages Act was passed and the state Governments was advised to fix the minimum wages accordingly. But due to some practical difficulties most of the states could not fix minimum wages till 1974.

**(iii) Distribution of Landless Laborers:**

After passing legislation for fixing ceiling on land holdings, state Government acquired surplus lands and distributed it among the landless labourers. About 74 lakh acres of land were acquired as surplus land and out of which 45 lakh acres were distributed among 41.5 lakh landless labourers. But most of these lands distributed are found unsuitable for cultivation.

**(iv) Provision for Housing Sites:**

Various states have passed necessary legislations for providing housing sites to agricultural labourers. The Second and Fourth Plans have undertaken various steps for this purpose. Again under Minimum Needs Programme and 20-Point Programme, high priority is being accorded to rural house site-cum-house construction scheme.

**(v) Various Employment Schemes:**

For providing alternative source of employment among the agricultural labourers various schemes have already been launched by both the central and the state Governments. These schemes include

- - Rural Works Programme (RWP),
  - Crash Scheme for Rural Employment (CSRE),
  - Employment Guarantee Scheme (EGS) by the Government of Maharashtra,
  - Food for Work Programme (FWP),
  - National Rural Employment Programme (NREP),
  - Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme (RLEGP),
  - Jawahar Rozgar Yojana (JRY) etc.

**(vi) Special Agencies:**

During the Fourth Plan two special agencies —

Small Farmers Development Agency (SFDA)

Marginal Farmers and Agricultural Labourers Development Agency (MFALA)

were developed for conducting Various works like irrigation, land leveling, soil conservation, dairy development, piggery development, poultry breeding etc. During the Fifth Plan both agencies were merged into a single programme.

**(vii) 20-Point Programme:**

The Government introduced the 20-point economic programme in July 1975 in which steps were taken to improve the economic condition of landless workers and other weaker sections of the society in the rural areas.

These steps include speedy implementation of ceiling laws and then distribute the surplus land among the landless, making provision for housing sites for landless labourers, abolition of bonded labour, liquidation of rural indebtedness.

**Suggestions for Improving the Conditions of Agricultural Labourers:**

- Implement the Minimum Wage Act seriously
- By improve their bargaining power
- Create alternative sources of employment by developing small scale and cottage industries in the rural areas.
- Improve- the conditions of agriculture by adopting improved intensive methods and multiple cropping.
- Improve the working conditions of agricultural labourers.
- Promote cooperative farming.
- To introduce social security measures for the agricultural workers.
- Introduce compulsory insurance on marginal contribution.
- Institute old age pension schemes for the agricultural workers by the government.

## Agriculture and Food processing industries

India’s food ecosystem offers huge opportunities for investments with stimulating growth in the food retail sector, favorable economic policies and attractive fiscal incentives. The Food & Grocery market in India is the **sixth largest** in the world. Food & Grocery retail market in India further constitutes almost 65% of the total retail market in India.

The Government of India through the **Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI)** is also taking all necessary steps to boost investments in the food processing industry. The government has sanctioned 41 food parks funded under **the Mega Food Parks Scheme** of which 38 have final approval; 22 are operational as of 1 August 2021.

**By 2025**, India’s food **processing sector** is expected to be worth over half a trillion dollars.

**By 2030**, Indian annual **household consumption** to treble, making India **5th** largest consumer.

**Food processing** is defined as transforming agricultural products into food that are in consumable form or transforming one food item into another by adding value to it.

Based on physical properties of the final product, the Ministry of Food Processing Industries categorizes food processing under two sub-categories, viz.,

- **manufactured processes**, whereby the original physical properties of the product undergo a change through a process \[involving employees, power, machines or money\] and the transformed product is edible and has a commercial value and
- other **value added processes** where the product does not undergo any manufacturing process, but gains significant value addition like increased shelf life, shelled and ready for consumption.

  - The importance of processed food items in the consumer basket has increased globally over time. With higher income, urbanization, demographic shifts, improved transportation and changed consumer perceptions regarding quality and safety, food consumption patterns have changed over the years.
  - The FPI accounts for a prominent place among sectors in terms of share in employment in the manufacturing sector and because of its labour intensive nature it has higher multiplier effect on the overall economy.
  - Globally, India ranks first in the export of processed and preserved fish and fish products, grain mill products and fourth in the export of sugar. However, even in these products, only about one fourth of the product is exported reflecting high proportion of consumption in the domestic economy.

- **Institutions:**
  - Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MOFPI):  
    The Ministry is nodal agency for FPI and is concerned with formulation and implementation of the policies & plan.
  - Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry:  
    Focuses on Development of industries for export by way of providing financial assistance or for undertaking surveys.
  - Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries:  
    The Department is responsible for matters relating to livestock production, preservation, and protection from disease and improvement of stocks and dairy development.
  - National Horticultural Board (NHB) under – Ministry of Agriculture  
    It aims for the Development of hi-tech commercial horticulture in identified belts.
- **Credit**  
  Ensuring availability of adequate credit to the food processing industries is given utmost importance by the Reserve Bank of India. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank has accorded **priority sector status to food processing industry**. Loans to food and agro-based processing units and cold chain have been classified under agricultural activities for priority sector lending.
- **Government Initiatives**:

Recognizing the role that FPI can play in promoting employment and income in the rural sector, the Government of India has identified it as a priority sector under the ‘Make in India’ Programme.

FPI offers an opportunity to reduce dependence on agriculture in the rural areas as the main employment generating sector. Various initiatives have been taken by the Government to promote this sector considering the challenges faced by the sector.

The Ministry of Food Processing Industries has identified six key challenges faced by the food processing industry:

- - gaps in supply chain infrastructure (i.e., lack of primary processing, storage and distribution facilities);
  - inadequate link between production and processing;
  - seasonality of operations and low capacity utilizations;
  - institutional gaps in supply chain, dependence on APMC markets.
  - inadequate focus on quality and safety standards.
  - lack of product development and innovation.
- Accordingly, the focus has been to smoothen the supply chain by creating infrastructure, promoting exports, improving quality standards, expanding supply of formal credit, particularly to small and medium enterprises, and broadening skilled labour pool in the economy.
- The **Indian Council for Fertilizer and Nutrient Research (ICFNR)** will adopt international best practices for research in fertilizer sector, which will enable farmers to get good quality fertilizers at affordable rates and thereby achieve food security for the common man.
- The Ministry of Food Processing Industries announced a scheme for Human Resource Development (HRD) in the food processing sector. The HRD scheme is being implemented through State Governments under the National Mission on Food Processing. The scheme has the following four components:

  - Creation of infrastructure facilities for degree/diploma courses in food processing sector
  - Entrepreneurship Development Programme (EDP)
  - Food Processing Training Centers (FPTC)
  - Training at recognized institutions at State/National level.

- **Mega Food Park:**

  - Development of **hi-tech commercial horticulture** in identified belts.
  - The Ministry has approved 39 Mega Food Park Projects (Final Approval–37 projects and in-principle Approval–2 projects). 7 of these **Mega Food Parks have female promotors**.
  - **Ministry of Food Processing Industries** is implementing the Mega Food Park Scheme
  - Mega Food Parks create **modern infrastructure facilities** for food processing along the value chain from farm to market with strong forward and backward linkages through a cluster-based approach.
  - The Scheme is based on the “**Cluster**” approach.
  - A Mega food Park typically consists of **supply chain** infrastructure including collection centers (cc), primary processing centers (ppc) central processing centers (cpc), cold chain and around 25-30 fully developed plots for entrepreneurs to set up food processing units.
  - Presently, **22 Mega Food Parks** are operational, which is in line with the ‘**Make in India’** and ‘**Atma Nirbhar Bharat’** vision of the Government of India.

- **Contribution of Food processing sector to GDP:**

Food Processing sector has been growing at an Average Annual Growth Rate (AAGR) of around 10.00% as compared to around 3.11% in Agriculture at 2011-12 Prices. Food Processing Sector has also emerged as an important segment of the Indian economy in terms of its contribution to GDP, employment and investment.

**The major challenges facing the sector are illustrated below:**

![Agriculture and Food processing industries](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Agriculture-and-Food-processing-industries.png)

**Recommendations:**

- A multi-sectoral approach must be adopted in the establishment of any food fortification programme, encompassing participation of relevant governmental organizations, food industry, trade organizations, consumers, academic and research facilities, marketing specialists and any involved international organizations and agencies.
- International guidelines to advise food aid donors on acceptable and safe fortification practices should be developed; guidelines should not be so restrictive as to impede the provision of high quality food aid commodities nor hinder communication on fortification between relevant parties.
- Surveys are required in a country to establish dietary patterns and habits which are critical inputs in determining appropriate vehicles for use in food fortification.
- Good Transportation facilities, storage and warehouse conditions need to be renovated.

## Indian agriculture in the present times

Since independence India has made much progress in agriculture. Indian agriculture, which grew at the rate of about 1 percent per annum during the fifty years before Independence, has grown at the rate of about 2.6 percent per annum in the post-Independence era. Expansion of area was the main source of growth in the period of fifties and sixties after that the contribution of increased land area under agricultural production has declined over time and increase in productivity became the main source of growth in agricultural production. Another important facet of progress in agriculture is its success in eradicating of its dependence on imported food grains. Indian agriculture has progressed not only in output and yield terms but the structural changes have also contributed. All these developments in Indian agriculture are contributed by a series of steps initiated by Indian Government. Land reforms, inauguration of Agricultural Price Commission with objective to ensure remunerative prices to producers, new agricultural strategy , investment in research and extension services, provision of credit facilities, and improving rural infrastructure are some of these steps.

## Growth trajectory

- India’s production of food grains has been increasing every year, and India is among the top producers of several crops such as wheat, rice, pulses, sugarcane and cotton. It is the highest producer of milk and second highest producer of fruits and vegetables. In 2013, India contributed 25% to the world’s pulses production, the highest for any one country, 22% to the rice production and 13% to the wheat production.  It also accounted for about 25% of the total quantity of cotton produced, besides being the second-highest exporter of cotton for the past several years.
- However, the agricultural yield (quantity of a crop produced per unit of land) is found to be lower in the case of most crops, as compared to other top producing countries such as China, Brazil and the United States.

![Growth Trajectory in Indian Agriculture](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Growth-Trajectory-in-Indian-Agriculture.png)

- Agricultural growth has been fairly volatile over the past decade, ranging from 5.8% in 2005-06 to 0.4% in 2009-10 and -0.2% in 2014-15. Such a variance in agricultural

growth has an impact on farm incomes as well as farmers’ ability to take credit for investing in their landholdings.

- Contribution to GDP over the years:

![Growth trajectory](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Growth-trajectory2.png)

**Role of agriculture in Indian economy:**

- Share in National Income
- Largest Employment Providing Sector.
- Contribution to Capital formation.
- Providing Raw Material to industries.
- Market for Industrial Products.

## Issues plaguing Indian agriculture

1.  According to 2010-11 Agriculture Census, the total number of operational holdings was 138.35 million with average size of 1.15 hectares (ha). Of the total holdings, 85 per cent are in marginal and small farm categories of less than 2 ha (GOI, 2014).
2.  Farming for subsistence which makes scale of economy in question with majority of small holdings.
3.  Low-access of credit and prominent role of unorganized creditors affecting decisions of farmers in purchasing of inputs and selling of outputs
4.  Less use of technology, mechanization and poor productivity for which first two points are of major concern
5.  Very less value addition as compared to developed countries and negligible primary-level processing at farmer’s level.
6.  Poor infrastructure for farming making more dependence on weather, marketing and supply chain suitable for high value crops.

**Importance in International Trade:**

- Share in national income.
- Source of employment.
- Provision of food grains.
- Supply of raw materials to industrial sector.
- Market for industrial product.
- Earner of foreign exchange.

## Programmes and policies introduced in India in recent times to address the issues

**E-NAM:**

National Agriculture Market (eNAM) is a Pan-India electronic trading portal which networks the existing APMC mandis to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities.

**National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA):**

National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) has been formulated for enhancing agricultural productivity especially in rain fed areas focusing on integrated farming, water use efficiency, soil health management and synergizing resource conservation.

**Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY):**

Government of India is committed to accord high priority to water conservation and its management. To this effect Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) has been formulated with the vision of extending the coverage of irrigation ‘Har Khet ko pani’ and improving water use efficiency ‘More crop per drop’ in a focused manner.

**Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY):**

The Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), an initiative to promote organic farming in the country, was launched by the NDA government in 2015.

**Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY):**

Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) is the government sponsored crop insurance scheme that integrates multiple stakeholders on a single platform.

**Livestock insurance Scheme:**

This scheme aims to provide protection mechanism to the farmers and cattle rearers against any eventual loss of their animals due to death and to demonstrate the benefit of the insurance of livestock to the people and popularize it with the ultimate goal of attaining qualitative improvement in livestock and their products.

**Scheme on Fisheries Training and Extension:**

It was launched to provide training for fishery sector so as to assist in undertaking fisheries extension programmes effectively.

**National Scheme on Welfare of Fishermen:**

This scheme was launched to provide financial assistance to fishers for construction of house, community hall for recreation and common working place. It also aims to install tube-wells for drinking water and assistance during lean period through saving cum relief component.

**Micro Irrigation Fund (MIF):**

The government approved a dedicated Rs5,000 crore fund to bring more land area under micro-irrigation as part of its objective to boost agriculture production and farmer’s income.

**Future of Indian Agriculture:**

1.  Future of agriculture is a very important question for the planners and all other stakeholders. Government and other organizations are trying to address the key challenges of agriculture in India, including small holdings of farmers, primary and secondary processing, supply chain, infrastructure supporting the efficient use of resources and marketing, reducing intermediaries in the market. There is a need for work on cost-effective technologies with environmental protection and on conserving our natural resources.
2.  There is a need for work on cost-effective technologies with environmental protection and on conserving our natural resources. Although its contribution in the gross domestic product (GDP) has reduced to less than 20 per cent and contribution of other sectors increased at a faster rate, agricultural production has grown. This has made us self-sufficient and taken us from being a begging bowl for food after independence to a net exporter of agriculture and allied products.
3.  Total food grain production in the country is estimated to be a record 291.95 million tones, according to the second advance estimates for 2019-20. This is news to be happy about but as per the estimates of Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR), demand for food grain would increase to 345 million tones by 2030.
4.  India is blessed with large arable land with 15 agro-climatic zones as defined by ICAR, having almost all types of weather conditions, soil types and capable of growing a variety of crops. India is the top producer of milk, spices, pulses, tea, cashew and jute, and the second-largest producer of rice, wheat, oilseeds, fruits and vegetables, sugarcane and cotton.
5.  Many startups in agriculture by highly educated young ones show that they are able to understand the high potential of putting money and efforts in this sector. Cumulative effects of technology over the next decade will change the face of agriculture.
6.  Advantageous weather and soil conditions, high demand for food, untapped opportunities, various fiscal incentives given by the government for inputs, production infrastructure, availability of cheap credit facilities and for marketing and export promotion are attracting many individuals, big companies, startups and entrepreneurial ventures to do a lot of investments on innovations, inventions, research and development and on other aspects of business.
7.  The country’s population in the next decade is expected to become the largest in the world and providing food for them will be a very prime issue. Farmers are still not able to earn respectable earnings.

## Some more measures or recommendations made by the committee to improve agricultural growth in India

The **National Commission on Farmers (NCF**) was constituted on November 18, 2004 under the chairmanship of Professor M.S. Swaminathan.

1.  Farmers need to have assured access and control over basic resources, which include land, water, bio resources, credit and insurance, technology and knowledge management, and markets. The NCF recommends that “Agriculture” be inserted in the Concurrent List of the Constitution.
2.  Establish a **National Land Use Advisory Service**, which would have the capacity to link land use decisions with ecological meteorological and marketing factors on a location and season specific basis.
3.  Set up a mechanism to regulate the sale of agricultural land, based on quantum of land, nature of proposed use and category of buyer.
4.  Increase water supply through **rainwater harvesting and recharge** of the aquifer should become mandatory. “Million Wells Recharge” programme, specifically targeted at private wells should be launched.
5.  Expand the outreach of the formal **credit system** to reach the really poor and needy.
6.  Reduce rate of interest for crop loans to 4 per cent simple, with government support.
7.  Restructure microfinance policies to serve as Livelihood Finance, i.e. credit coupled with support services in the areas of technology, management and markets.
8.  Cover all crops by crop insurance with the village and not block as the unit for assessment to **avoid farmers suicide**.

**Conclusion:**

- Change is happening in rural India but it has still a long way to go.
- Agriculture has benefited from improved farming techniques but the growth is not equitable.
- Land use is changing in rural areas as farmers are getting good value for their holdings. The effort should be to stop the migration to urban areas.
- The number of essential commodities should be reduced to an absolute minimum, especially the non-food crops.
