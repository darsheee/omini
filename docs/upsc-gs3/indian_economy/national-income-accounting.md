A. The Pre Liberalization Era: National and Per capita income: patterns, trends, aggregate and Sectoral composition and changes theirin.

- Gross Domestic Product (GDP) represents the total value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders, serving as a measure of the economy's size.
- GDP calculation avoids double-counting by including only the final value of a product, not the components used in its production.
- The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in the U.S. measures GDP quarterly and revises these estimates monthly based on updated data.
- GDP is calculated by summing personal consumption expenditures (C), business investments (I), government spending (G), and the net of exports (X) and imports (M).
- GDP can be measured in various ways, including nominal GDP, which is a raw measurement that includes price increases and is measured with current market prices.
- Real GDP is a measure of economic output that accounts for inflation or deflation, providing a more accurate assessment of growth than nominal GDP.
- The BEA calculates real GDP by removing the effects of inflation, allowing for comparison of economic figures from different years.
- Real GDP excludes incomes from U.S. companies and individuals from outside the country, eliminating the impact of exchange rates and trade policies.
- Real GDP is a crucial indicator of an economy's position in the business cycle and can help in making informed financial decisions.
- Nominal GDP includes both prices and growth, while real GDP represents pure growth, making nominal GDP typically higher.
- Real GDP measures the final output of all goods and services produced in the U.S. in the prior quarter, excluding the components used in production.
- Real GDP also measures services, including those provided by non-profits and the U.S. military, as well as housing services provided by homeowners.
- Real GDP is used to compute economic growth, with the percentage change in real GDP representing the GDP growth rate.
- The GDP growth rate is crucial for investors to adjust their asset allocation and for the Federal Reserve to decide on the fed funds rate.
- Real GDP can be used to compare the size of economies worldwide, but to account for different costs of living, purchasing power parity must be used.
- Nominal GDP should be used when other variables do not exclude inflation, such as when comparing debt to GDP.
- The GDP growth rate impacts personal finance, investments, and job growth, with investors using it to adjust their asset allocation and find international opportunities.
- The Federal Reserve uses the growth rate to determine monetary policy, implementing expansionary policy to ward off recession and contractionary policy to prevent inflation.
- The GDP growth rate affects interest rates, with rising growth rates leading to increased interest rates to curb inflation.
- Slow or negative growth can lead to layoffs and unemployment, making unemployment a lagging indicator.
- GDP data can be broken down to examine specific sectors and products, helping to identify growing and declining sectors even during economic downturns.
- Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the market value of all products and services within a country's borders, but it has limitations.
- GDP does not account for environmental costs, such as pollution, which can impact societal well-being.
- Unpaid services, such as childcare and volunteer work, are not included in GDP calculations despite their significant economic and societal impact.
- GDP does not account for the shadow or black economy, underestimating economic output in countries where income is largely derived from illegal activities.

- Gross National Product (GNP) measures the value of all goods and services produced by a country's residents and businesses, irrespective of the location of production.
- GNP excludes income earned in the country by foreign residents or businesses and products manufactured in the country by overseas firms.
- GNP is calculated by adding national consumption, investment, net exports, and net income earned by domestic residents from overseas investments, subtracting net income earned by foreign residents from domestic investments.

- Gross National Income (GNI) measures a country's income, including all income earned by a country's residents, businesses, and earnings from foreign sources.
- GNI is used to classify and group economies using purchasing power parity and the per capita method to compare different countries' standard of living.
- GNI differs from GDP as it includes wages, salaries, and property income of the country's residents earned abroad and at home, and net taxes and subsidies receivable from abroad.
- GNI differs from GNP as GNP includes earnings from all assets owned by residents, even earnings that don't flow back into the country, and omits earnings of all foreigners living in the country.

- Fiscal policy refers to the decisions made by the U.S. government about spending and tax collection, and how these decisions influence the economy.
- The government must consider the impact of its financial decisions on businesses, consumers, foreign markets, and other stakeholders.

- Fiscal policy refers to the actions taken by a government to influence an economy through purchasing products and services from businesses and collecting taxes.
- Governments can manipulate fiscal policy to stimulate or slow down the economy as needed, typically through adjustments in spending and taxation.
- Economies follow a cyclical pattern of expansion, peak, contraction, and trough, known as the business or economic cycle.
- Fiscal policy is used alongside the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, which uses the supply of money and interest rates to influence inflation and lending.
- The government uses two tools in implementing fiscal policy: collecting taxes and government spending.
- Fiscal policy can be automatic or discretionary, with discretionary fiscal policies being the most commonly referred to.
- Expansionary fiscal policy involves measures taken by the government to inject more money into the economy, stimulating economic growth and job creation.
- Contractionary fiscal policy is used during economic booms to slow growth and control inflation by collecting more taxes and reducing spending.
- Fiscal policy differs from monetary policy, which involves decisions to change the purchasing power of the U.S dollar and manage interest rates to influence the economy.
- Monetary policy works more quickly than fiscal policy, with changes in interest rates impacting the economy within six months.
- The health of the economy is a complex equation, with no single factor acting alone to produce an effect. However, tax increases can stimulate the economy by leading to greater government spending on infrastructure or social welfare programs, creating jobs and boosting consumer security.
- The term "laissez-faire" refers to a philosophy advocating for minimal government intervention, allowing the market to self-regulate. However, modern approaches in the U.S. use fiscal policy tools to prevent the economy from reaching dangerous extremes.
