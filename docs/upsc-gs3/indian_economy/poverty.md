# Poverty

[[toc]]

## Definition of Poverty

- Poverty is the state of one who lacks a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions.
- Poverty is said to exist when people lack the means to satisfy their basic needs
- In this context, the identification of poor people first requires a determination of what constitutes basic needs
- These may be defined as narrowly as “those necessary for survival” or as broadly as “those reflecting the prevailing standard of living in the community.”

### Various Methodologies Proposed by Various Committees for Calculation of Poverty

Various expert groups constituted by the Planning Commission have estimated the number of people living in poverty in India

## Working Group (1962)

- The poverty line in India was quantified for the first time in 1962, by this Group
- in terms of a minimum requirement (food and non-food) of individuals for healthy living
- The Group formulated separate poverty lines for rural and urban areas (₹20 and ₹25 per capita per month respectively in terms of 1960-61 prices) without any regional variation
- The poverty line excluded expenditure on health and education, both of which, were to be provided by the State

## Study by VM Dandekar and N Rath (1971)

- the origins of India’s poverty line lie in the seminal work of these two economists
- They first established the consumption levels required to meet a minimum calorie norm, of 2,250 calories per capita per day
- Unlike previous scholars who had considered subsistence living or basic minimum needs criteria as the measure of poverty line, they derived poverty line from the expenditure adequate to provide 2250 calories per day in both rural and urban areas

## Task Force on “Projections of Minimum Needs and Effective Consumption Demand” headed by Dr. Y. K. Alagh (1979)

- Official poverty counts began for the first time in India based on the approach of this Task Force
- Poverty line was defined as the per capita consumption expenditure level to meet average per capita daily calorie requirement of 2400 kcal per capita per day in rural areas and 2100 kcal per capita per day in urban areas
- Based on 1973-74 prices, the Task Force set the rural and urban poverty lines at 49.09 and Rs.56.64 per capita per month at 1973-74 prices.

## Lakdawala Expert Group (1993)

- It did not redefine the poverty line and retained the separate rural and urban poverty lines recommended by the Alagh Committee at the national level based on minimum nutritional requirements.
- However, it disaggregated them into state-specific poverty lines in order to reflect the inter-state price differentials
- Over the years, this method lost credibility.

## Tendulkar Expert Group (2009)

- suggested several changes
- It recommended a shift away from basing the poverty lines from calorie norms used in all poverty estimations since 1979 and towards target **nutritional** outcomes instead
- Instead of two separate poverty line baskets (PLBs) for rural and urban poverty lines, it **recommended a uniform all-India urban Poverty Line Baskets** across rural and urban India.
- It recommended **incorporation of private expenditure on health and education** while estimating poverty.
- Instead of monthly household consumption, consumption expenditure was broken up into per person per day consumption, resulting in the figure of Rs 32 and Rs 26 a day for urban and rural areas.
- As a result, the national poverty line for 2011-12 was estimated at Rs. 816 per capita per month for rural areas and Rs. 1,000 per capita per month for urban areas

## Rangrajan Committee

- Rangarajan Committee was set up in 2012
- <mark>Committee moves away</mark> from a calorie intake-based approach
- Inculded consumption expenditure on health & education
- Recommended a significantly higher poverty line
- It reverted to the practice of having separate all-India rural and urban poverty line baskets and deriving state-level rural and urban estimates from these.
- It recommended separate consumption baskets for rural and urban areas which include food items that ensure recommended calorie, protein & fat intake and non-food items like clothing, education, health, housing and transport.
- <text style="color:red"> Govt didn't accepted the recommendations of the Rangarajan Committee</text>

### Impact of LPG reform on reducing poverty in India

## Classification of Poverty

On the basis of social, economic and Political aspects, Poverty can be classified as follows:

### Absolute poverty

- Also known as extreme poverty or abject poverty, it involves the scarcity of basic food, clean water, health, shelter, education and information.

### Relative Poverty

- It is defined from the social perspective, that is living standard compared to the economic standards of population living in surroundings. Hence it is a measure of income inequality

### Situational Poverty

- It is a temporary type of poverty based on occurrence of an adverse event like environmental disaster, job loss and severe health problem
- People can help themselves even with a small assistance, as the poverty comes because of unfortunate event

<!-- Poverty declined faster but inequality increased in the post-reform period
India still has 300 million people below the poverty line
The Gini coefficient measured in terms of consumption for rural India increased marginally from 0.29 in 1993-94 to 0.31 in 2011-12
There was a significant rise in the Gini coefficient for urban areas from 0.34 to 0.39 during the same period

### Reasons why poverty still exists in India
**Heavy pressure of population**

- India’s population was 84.63 crores in 1991 and became 102.87 crores in 2001
- Rapid population growth causes excessive sub-division and fragmentation of holdings. As a result, per capita availability of land has greatly declined and households do not have access to sufficient land to produce enough output and income for them.
- Rapid growth in population in India since 1951 has caused lower growth in per capita income causing lower living standards of the people

**Unemployment and under employment**
- Due to continuous rise in population, there is chronic unemployment and under employment in India.
- There is educated unemployment and disguised unemployment, and Poverty is just a reflection of this aspect


**Lack of Inclusive Economic Growth**

- The first important reason for mass poverty prevailing in India is lack of adequate economic growth in India
- Despite increase in National Income and Savings rate since independence, poverty in India did not reduce sufficiently as:
- industrial growth did not generate much employment opportunities
- Growth strategy mainly benefitted the rich, than aiding the poor
- Capital intensive and labour-displacing technology was adopted in the growing industries. As a result, unemployment and underemployment increased
- Besides, due to the increase in income inequalities during this period, rise in average per capita income could not bring about significant rise in per capita income of the weaker sections of the society
- Further, trickledown effect of overall economic growth was operating only to a small extent

 **Sluggish Agricultural Performance and Poverty**

 - The experience of Punjab and Haryana shows that, the agricultural growth through use of new high yielding technology (during Green revolution), poverty ratio can be significantly reduced
- However, in various states of the country such as Orissa, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, East Uttar Pradesh, where poverty ratio is still very high; new high-yielding technology has not been adopted on a significant scale and as a result agricultural performance has not been good. As a result, poverty prevails to a larger extent in them.
- Further, Indian policy makers have neglected public sector investment in agriculture, particularly irrigation
- As a result, irrigation facilities whose availability ensures adoption of new high-yielding technology and leads to higher productivity, income and employment, are available in not more than 33 per cent of cultivable land
- As a result, many parts of the country remain semi-arid and rain-fed areas, where agricultural productivity, income and employment are not sufficient to ensure significant reduction in poverty

**Non-implementation of Land Reforms**

- Equitable access to land is an important measure of poverty reduction
- Access to adequate land, a productive asset, is necessary for fuller employment of members of an agricultural household
- Most of the rural poor are agricultural labourers (who are generally landless) and self-employed small farmers owning less than 2 acres of land
- They also are unable to find employment throughout the year. As a result, they remain unemployed and under-employed for a large number of days in a year

**Inflation and Food Prices**

-  Inflation, especially rise in food prices, raises the cost of minimum consumption expenditure required to meet the basic needs. Thus, inflation pushes down many households below the poverty line

As assessment of Poverty Alleviation programmes, state three major areas of concern which prevent their successful implementation

- Due to unequal distribution of land and other assets, the benefits from direct poverty alleviation programmes have been appropriated by the non-poor
- Compared to the magnitude of poverty, the amount of resources allocated for these programmes is not sufficient
- The programmes depend mainly on government and bank officials for their implementation. Since such officials are ill motivated, inadequately trained, corruption prone and vulnerable to pressure from a variety of local elites, the resources are inefficiently used and wasted
- There is also non-participation of local level institutions in programme implementation
- Overlapping of similar government schemes is a major cause of ineffectiveness as it leads to confusion among poor people and authorities and the benefits of the scheme do not reach the poor.
- The poverty alleviation program may not properly identify and target the exact number of poor families in rural areas. As a result, some of the families who are not registered under these programs are benefited by the facilities rather than the eligible ones

**Shortage of Capital and Able Entrepreneurship**

- Capital and able entrepreneurship have important role in accelerating the growth. But these are in short supply making it difficult to increase production significantly, when compared to other developing countries

**Social Factors**

- The social set up is still backward and is not conducive to faster development.
Laws of inheritance, caste system, traditions and customs are putting hindrances in the way of faster development and have aggravated the problem of poverty

### Actions required to address the above issues
**More Citizen participation**

-Without the active participation of the poor, successful implementation of any programme is not possible
-Poverty can effectively be eradicated only when the poor start contributing to growth by their active involvement in the growth process.
-This is possible through a process of social mobilisation, encouraging poor people to participate to get them empowered

**Accelerating Economic Growth**

- While efforts should be made to accelerate economic growth, the use of capital-intensive technologies imported from the Western Countries should be avoided
- Instead, we should pursue labour-intensive path of economic growth.
- Such monetary and fiscal policies should be adopted that provide incentives for using labour-intensive techniques

**Agricultural Growth and Poverty Alleviation**

- The higher agricultural growth leads to lower poverty ratio. The expe­rience of Punjab and Haryana has confirmed this inverse relation between agriculture growth and poverty.
- It is also true that, all India level employment generated by new green revolution technology has been cancelled out by increasing mechanisation of agricultural operations in various parts of a country
- Thus, in the light of the finding of zero employment elasticity of agricultural output, positive impact of agricultural growth on the incomes of small farmers and, more particularly on the wage income of agricultural labourers, cannot be denied
- Hence, the need to balance between the two aspects
- Also, there is need to increase public investment in infrastructure and ensure adequate access to credit to the small farmers

**Accelerating Human Resource Development**

- Focus on Education, Health and Skill development, not only generates a good deal of employment opportunities but also raises productivity and income of the poor
- Hence, the need of efficient implementation of schemes like Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) etc, going forward

**Growth of Non-Farm Employment**

- For reduction of poverty, growth of non-farm employ­ment in the rural areas is of special importance.
- Non-farm employment can be created in marketing (i.e., petty trade), transportation, handicrafts, dairying, and forestry, processing of food and other agricultural products, repair workshops, etc.

**Providing access to more Assets to vulnerable sections**

 - Rapid growth of population after independence has led to greater sub- di­vision and fragmentation of agricultural holdings, and this has resulted in lack of employment opportunities for agricultural labourers
- Redistribution of land through effective measures, such as implementation of tenancy reforms so as to ensure security of tenure and fixation of fair rent could be an important measure of reducing rural poverty

**Poverty alleviation has always been accepted as one of India’s main challenges by the policy makers**

 - There is improvement in terms of per capita income and average standard of living; even though some progress towards meeting the basic needs has been made; But when compared to the progress made by many other countries, our performance has not been impressive
- Hence, the need of actions to enable the fruits of development to reach all sections of the population -->
