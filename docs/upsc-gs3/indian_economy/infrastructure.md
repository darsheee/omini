### Relationship between infrastructure and economic development

### Energy

### Coal

#### Importance of Coal in India

Coal is one of the main sources of energy in India. Accordingly, affordable and sustainable supply of coal is inextricably linked to the goal of ensuring energy security in India.

It currently accounts for 55% to 70 % of India’s total energy consumption (CSO 2013)

<table><tbody><tr><td>Details</td><td>Million Tonnes</td></tr><tr><td>Total consumption of coal</td><td>942</td></tr><tr><td>Domestic Production</td><td>730</td></tr><tr><td>Imports</td><td>212</td></tr></tbody></table>

Reason for high reliance on coal – non-viability of large-scale use of alternate sources of energy.

It will remain the most viable fuel for driving economic growth for many years to come

see TERI and PSA 2006; Ministry of Coal 2005; Planning Commission 2005.

About 75% of the total coal produced in India is used for power generation

Coal Reserves In India – estimated at 286 billion tonnes. It is sufficient to meet India’s demand for at least the next 100 years.                                                              (Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM 2012),

India is the second largest coal importer, despite having the world’s fourth largest coal reserves and being the second largest producer

Coal Reserves in India

coal sector, which has dominant use in three core sectors i.e. power, steel, cement.

India has 4th largest reserves of coal and holds about 286 billion of world’s some 850 billion of proven reserves.

Indian coal is classified in 2 categories i.e.

1.  coking coal and
2.  non-coking coal.

This is a usage based classification, as coking coal is essential for Iron and steel industry.

More, streamlined classification is on basis of carbon content and stage of formation.

Coal is formed by fossils of plants, trees, bushes etc. which got deposited in shallow basins millons of year ago. Later decomposition by bacteria converts it into **peat**, which is generally unviable to mine. After this bio- chemical action ceases and geo chemical action becomes dominant. It results in gradual development of Lignite, Bituminous and Anthracite coal.

Peat is Impure, has very low carbon content (in turn calorific value) of about 40%. Lignite, bituminous, anthracite coal has carbon content of 40-60%, 60-80% and 80-90% respectively. Remaining matter in the coal is called volatile material such as moisture, ash content and sulfur content. These are gradually removed by metamorphic process i.e. pressure and heat.

Bituminous coal has special significance because it contains Bitumen which on heating in absence of oxygen is converted into coking coal. This removes volatile material in the coal and is further heated to get Coke, which is used in blast furnaces to extract iron from iron ore.

This type of Coking coal is what India lacks, as 88 % of reserves are of Non Coking type and rest 12 % have high Ash content. Indian Coking Coal is cheap and of poor quality and imported Coking coal is expensive and good quality. Steel industry blends both to secure a moderate cost and quality.

**![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Coal-Reserves.jpg)**

**Production From These Reserves Has Been Dismal Mainly Due To Following:**

(Screening committee specified time limits for production ranging from 36-54 months from time of allocation)

1.  Delayed environment and forest clearances:  
    Environment ministry Classified ecological sensitive areas in ‘Go and No Go areas’.

Total prohibition is there on mining in no go areas.

And these areas contain 30 % of total allocated mining reserves.

2.  Further there are other clearances required from State and Central Governments.
3.  Land Acquisition problems
4.  Lack of adequate Technology
5.  Consent of Gram Sabha should be mandatory before commencement of mining and Some proceeds of mining revenue should go to ‘Districts Mineral Foundation’ for benefit of affected persons and their families.

This resulted in situation where India has to import coal to the tune of 171 million tons. In comparison Coal India produced 462 million tons of coal. Some Indian companies and also CIL have acquired coalmines overseas to ensure continuous supply.

#### Procedure established till now in Coal Mining

- Until now there were **restrictions** on who could **bid for coal mines** only those in power, iron and steel and coal washery business could bid for mines and the bidders needed prior experience of mining in India.
- This effectively **limited the potential bidders** to a select circle of players and thus **limited the value** that the government could extract from the bidding.
- Second, **end-use restrictions** inhibited the development of a domestic market for coal.
- The ordinance essentially **democratises the coal industry** and makes it attractive for merchant mining companies, including multinationals such as BHP and Rio Tinto, to look at India.
- The move was overdue considering that the **country spent a huge Rs.1,71,000 crore in coal imports last year to buy 235 million tonnes**; of that, 100 million tonnes was not substitutable, as the grade was not available in India.
- But the balance **135 million tonnes** could have been **substituted by domestic production had it been available.**

#### Why allotments were cancelled for Captive blocks held by private players and PSUs?

Allocation process was arbitrary, discretionary and non-transparent.

There was no consideration of Merit, no Price discovery mechanism for national resources (Auction is price discovery mechanism).

Further, no ‘minutes of meeting’ were available of screening committee meetings to verify what procedure was adopted by them (every government related meeting needs to prepare Minutes of meeting, which contain discussions, viewpoints, points of disagreements and consensus etc, for transparency and future reference).

To some allocates, blocks were allotted having reserves more than their project needs. Screening Committee relied on data supplied by applicants in arriving at decision.

Law for allocation of natural resources, as upheld by Supreme Court holds that allocation can’t be done in ‘arbitrary manner’. By this same reasoning Spectrum allocation Licenses were cancelled.

**Why allotments to State PSU’s were cancelled?**

As we have seen that, state PSUs got blocks with no end use restriction. It means they can engage in Commercial Mining i.e. selling coal in open market. But Coal nationalization Law clearly states that commercial mining can be done only centrally owned PSUs. So they were cancelled.

Apart from this some allocations were made to joint ventures of private and public, Joint allocation of Coal Mines to consortium of companies – these were also cancelled.

UMPPs were allowed to transfer coals from or to other project, but Supreme Court held that law disallows this too.

New government has given approval to an ordinance, empowering government to take back mines and reallocating it.

Currently Coal India and other coal suppliers issue ‘**letter of assurances**’ to their buyers in power sector mainly NTPC, these are on the basis of ‘Milestones’ to be achieved by power producers (milestone of good conduct as buyer).

After achievement of this milestone ‘**Fuel Supply Agreement**’ is signed between supplier and buyer. Dominantly these supplier and buyers are only government entities; even then there is cumbersome process and mutual hostilities, mainly between Coal India and National Thermal Power Corporation.

In 1993, government created 3 separate ministries (which should be logically 1) I.e. of coal, power and renewable energy respectively. Coal minister and Power ministers held Cabinet Rank. This resulted in awkward situation in which two ministries used to work in opposite direction and which disrupted the speed of clearances, flow of information etc. There were many instances like nonpayment at time by NTPC to CIL due to allegations of low quality supplies kept surfacing. But now as Ministry of Power and coal is headed by one minister, that too minister of state, so much speedy disposal of issues are expected.

#### Coal Sector Reforms

**Objective – 4 fold – to increase**

1.  Investment,
2.  Production,
3.  Employment and
4.  Boost to Make in India initiative

**Mineral Laws (Amendment) Act, 2020**

It Amends the

1.  Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 \[CMSP Act\]
2.  Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 \[MMDR Act\].

**Provisions**

1.  Allocation of coal blocks for **composite prospecting license-cum-mining lease**

It will help in increasing of the inventory of coal, lignite blocks for allocation.

1.  Provision for requirement of Approval from Centre – Done away

In cases where the allocation or reservation of coal/lignite block has been made by the Central Govt. itself

1.  Provided **flexibility to the Central Govt.** in deciding the **end-use of Schedule II and III coal mines** under the CMSP Act.

**Government introduced a slew of reforms such as**

1.  Easing participation norms for bidders, – More competition
2.  Eliminating end-use restrictions,
3.  Shifting from rupee per Tonne model to **revenue-sharing model**
4.  Government has introduced a more equitable system of sharing revenues, moving away from fixed rates to an ad-valorem system.

So when the prices go up, the miner shares more with the government and if they decrease, he shares less. This is equitable for both the parties.

5.  Permitting 100 per cent foreign direct investment in the coal sector – foreign players
6.  The eligibility criteria has been done away with, and no coal mining experience is required to take part in the auction process.
7.  Simplified the process of the mining plan approval process from 90 days to 30 days.
8.  Other relevant measures include
    1.  Promoting coal gasification through rebate in revenue share, and
    2.  An investment of ₹50,000 crore to create transportation infrastructure for evacuating one billion tonnes of coal from state-run Coal India’s mines.

#### Impact and Effect of Reforms

1.  Easing of participating norms – will lead to the induction of new technology and competition in the sector. Consequently, the economies of coal-bearing states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Odisha will also grow since all the revenue from these auctions will accrue exclusively to them.
2.  Allowing auction will lead to
    1.  It will lead to introduction of new technology and completion in the sector.

Foreign players will bring investment, technology and best practices to India.

1.  Opportunity for Investment in Commodity Business.
2.  where domestic supply falls short of the demand, opening up an opportunity to substitute 135 MT coal imports.

3.  A transparent and efficient auction process will attract investments, boost competition & benefit consumer
4.  Immediate visible impacts have been
    1.  In 2014 – Critical stocks with the Power Plant was for only 7 days. Now they have 30 day stock on average.
    2.  From being a heavy importer of coal, India is now 2nd largest producer of coal – at 729 million tonnes (MT) in 2019-20.

Government should try to remove any road blocks in conducting the auction process. For instance, a major issue faced by the bidders is lack of clarity on payment of stamp duty, which differs from one State to other.

**Ministry of Coal has started Commercial Auction of coal mines on revenue share basis.**

- In order to arrive at the revenue share based on market prices of coal, **National Coal Index (NCI)** was conceptualized.

**What is the NCI?**

The NCI is a price index which reflects the change of price level of coal on a particular month relative to the fixed base year.

- The base year for the NCI is FY 2017-18.
- Rolled out on 4th June 2020.

The aim is to have an index that will truly reflect the market price of coal.

**Benefits:**

- For taxation purpose, the Coal Index will be the base indicator.
- For future calculation of upfront amount and intrinsic value of mine, this Index will be helpful.
- For calculation of annual escalation (monthly payment), this index can be basis.

#### Clean Coal Energies

**Coal Bed Methane**

![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Clean-Coal-Energies.jpg)

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Clean-Coal-Energies.jpg?resize=309%2C370&ssl=1)

It is natural gas which is found in coal seams in absorbed form. It is similar to natural gas found in in oil & natural gas blocks (both are CH4). It is clean pipeline gas and can be used almost without any processing.

**Why it is important to extract CBM?  
**

1.  Methane is hazard in Mines. Being poisonous, it can cause serious harm to miners. So it is better to extract this in advance.
2.  Methane is very potent greenhouse gas (about 20 times than CO2). So it shouldn’t be let escape to environment when it can be captured.
3.  It is very viable resource. It has good calorific value and about half the emissions that of coal.

Coal Bed Methane Policy is in place from 1997. 4 rounds of auctions have taken place allocating 33 gas blocks. Commercial production has started in some blocks.

Director General of Hydrocarbons, Coal India Ltd and Ministry of Oil and Petroleum cooperate for CBM policy. For its extraction well is dug through which water in the coal seam is taken out. It results in reabsorption of methane in pores and through same well CBM is taken out.

**Carbon Sequestering** – This is technique for ‘enhanced coal bed methane recovery’. Here CO2 will be pumped in to coal seam. Coal has better absorption capacity of CO2 and it will result in more desorption of CBM.

**Coal Gasification and Liquefaction  
**

This gives Methane, Hydrogen, Carbon monoxide by combination of Coal, Water and oxygen. These products can be used for power generation and industrial processes. Oxygen and water is pumped in seam which decomposes coal in above products and these are extracted through a well.

Same way, under liquefaction coal under heat and pressure is converted in high value petrochemical. However this is expensive process and only viable if prices of oil is high.

Government has made projects of underground coal gasification and liquefaction eligible to be treated as captive for allocation of coal mines.

Coal liquefication also called Coal to Liquid (CTL) technology is an alternative route to produce diesel and gasoline

**Transitioning from Coal**

Alternatives

1.  Hydropower
2.  Solar energy
3.  Natural gas
4.  Biomass

Efforts in direction of Alternatives

**National Mission on use of Biomass in coal based thermal power plants**

**Biomass Cofiring**

It refers to the concurrent blending and combustion of [biomass materials](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/biomass-energy/#:~:text=Biomass%20is%20organic%2C%20meaning%20it,a%20non%2Drenewable%20energy%20source.) with other fuels such as natural gas and coal within a boiler, which reduce the use of fossil fuels for energy generation and emissions without significantly increasing costs and infrastructure investments.

**Benefits of Cofiring:**

1.  It decreases the use of fossil fuels and hence mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.
2.  Coal and biomass cofiring accounts for the relevant advantages of a relative ease of implementation and an effective reduction of CO2 and other pollutant (SOx, NOx) emissions to the atmosphere.
3.  Cofiring biomass with coal may record no loss in total boiler efficiency after adjusting combustion output for the new fuel mixture.

**Challenges it poses**

- Roadmap for workers and communities dependent on fossil fuels

  - Employ about 2.24 lakh workers.
  - In addition to it –
    - contract employees working for mine development operators (MDOs),
    - captive mines under private players,
    - employed in coal transportation activities
    - employed in coal-consuming sectors like power, steel, sponge iron,

- - The challenge in transitioning coal workers in India is also in factors like education, skill levels, willingness to migrate, and caste.
- Revenure

1.  - coal accounts for about 40 percent of total freight revenues — not to
    - GST compensation cess from coal on Coal (FY 2020) – Rs 29,200 crore
    - A transition away from coal must account for the loss to the state and district exchequer.

### Power

### Transport system in India’s economic development

### Growth in Indian railways

**Importance**

The Indian Railways is the lifeline of India. With its vast network across the length and breadth of India, it is not just a mere transporter of passengers and goods but also a social welfare organization.

Indian Railways (IR) has the **4th longest rail network** in the world. It is a network of 70,000 km and runs about 21,000 trains, carrying 23 million passengers and 3 million tonnes of freight per day.

- Railways stretch their hands in conducting activities like business, sightseeing, pilgrimage along with transportation of goods.
- It is easier for long-distance travel.
- Plays a vital role in national integration.
- Railways hold a major hand in the economy of the country
- It strengthens the development of the industry and agriculture.
- Railways are the most preferred transport.
- They have the capacity to carry huge loads and bulky goods for long and short distances.

**Government Initiatives**

**The government has set a vision of making railways a 100% safe, fast and reliable mode of transport for passengers and freight.**

- Rising passenger & freight traffic

Increasing urbanization, rising incomes (both rural and urban), growing industrialization across the country along with private sector participation

- Increasing freight traffic

Growing industrialization across the country

- Dedicated freight corridor

Six high-capacity, high-speed dedicated freight corridors

- Freight Business Development Portal

One-stop cargo solution for seamless goods transportation

- Diamond Quadrilateral network of high-speed rail

Connecting major metros and growth centers of the country

![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dedicated-freight-Corridors.jpg)

**Reforms in Railways**

Speed and changes

While raising the maximum running speed to 160 kmph is welcome measure, accomplishing this in the timeframe given will be difficult. Nearly all trunk routes in the existing network are speed limited to 110 kmph (maximum speed); very few permit speeds of upto 120-130 kmph.

To raise it to 160 kmph, as proposed, there has to be

- track strengthening,
- elimination of curves and level crossing gates and
- strengthening of bridges.
- track fencing especially in densely populated areas.

![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rail-Reforms.jpg)

From the timings for different trains given by the Railway Board, there is no appreciable reduction in transit time for most trains when compared with the timings of the fastest train now operating on that route. This requires a critical review.

**Privatization of Railways**

Acc. To Government, the “objective of the initiative was to introduce modern technology rolling stock with reduced maintenance, reduced transit time, boost job creation, provide enhanced safety, provide world-class travel experience to passengers, and also reduce the demand-supply deficit in the passenger transportation sector

1.  **Improved Infrastructure–**It will lead to better infrastructure which in turn would lead to improved amenities for travelers.
2.  **Balancing Quality of Service with High Fares–** The move would foster competition and hence lead to overall betterment in the quality of services.
3.  **Lesser Accidents–** Because private ownership is synonymous with better maintenance, supporters of privatization feel that it will reduce the number of accidents, thus resulting in safe travel and higher monetary savings in the long run.

**Cons:**

1.  **Coverage Limited to Lucrative Sectors –**An advantage of Indian Railways being government-owned is that it provides nationwide connectivity irrespective of profit. This would not be possible with privatization since routes that are less popular will be eliminated, thus having a negative impact on connectivity. It will also render some parts of the country virtually inaccessible and omit them from the process of development.
2.  **Fares –** Given that a private enterprise runs on profit, it is but natural to assume that the easiest way of accruing profits in Indian Railways would be to hike fares, thus rendering the service out of reach for lower-income groups. This will defeat the entire purpose of the system which is meant to serve the entire population of the country irrespective of the level of income.
3.  **Accountability –** Private companies are unpredictable in their dealings and do not share their governance secrets with the world at large. In such a scenario it would be difficult to pin the accountability on a particular entity, should there be a discrepancy.
4.  **Fixing responsibility in case of an accident –** The responsibility of the private investor ends with investment in the procurement and maintenance of coaches. Train operation, safety, and dealing with everyday problems rests with the Railways. In case of an unfortunate event, how do we fix responsibility when the coaches are owned by the investor but operated by the Railways and its staff? The provision of an independent regulator to resolve the disagreement, discords, and disputes will not solve day-to-day problems of dichotomy unless the basic issue is resolved.

5.  In the private sector, operations are run with an eye on staff costs which can endanger safety. Also, the private investor is not bound to follow reservation regulations in employment, in turn depriving employment opportunities for those who are on the margins of society.

There should be no need for the government to take a dual role of a facilitator as well as a participant.

In the case of the metro railway services (Hyderabad, for example), an ideal PPP project, the concessionaire is solely responsible for daily maintenance, operation, passenger amenities, and staff issues. The State government steps in when it comes to land, power, permissions, law, and order, etc. Fare determination is in consultation with the government.

Railways or government have no role in fixing passenger fares. Full liberty is being given to the concessionaire to unilaterally fix fares for these proposed trains that are on a par with air and air-conditioned bus fares. It will be beyond the common man’s reach. Fare concessions extended to several categories of people will not be made available by the private investor. The very objective of commissioning the Railways as a public welfare transport organization is defeated.

**Restructuring of the Railway Board and Unification of Railway services into a single Cadre**

**Initial System in Railways**

The Indian Railways is governed by a pool of officers, among whom engineers are recruited after the Indian Engineering Service Examination, and civil servants through the Civil Services Examination. The civil servants are in the Indian Railway Traffic Service (IRTS), Indian Railway Accounts Service (IRAS) and Indian Railway Personnel Service (IRPS). The engineers are in five technical service cadres — Indian Railway Service of Engineers (IRSE), Indian Railway Service of Mechanical Engineers (IRSME), Indian Railway Service of Electrical Engineers (IRSEE), Indian Railway Service of Signal Engineers (IRSSE) and the Indian Railway Stores Service (IRSS).

Until the 1950s, the Railways system was run by officers from just three main streams: Traffic, Civil Engineering, and Mechanical. The other streams emerged as separate services over time.

It has led to inter-departmental rivalry. The government wants to end inter-departmental rivalries, which it says have been hindering growth for decades.  **Departments were working “in silos”.**

Unification has been recommended by several committees—

- **Prakash Tandon**(1994),
- **Khanna** (1998),
- **Rakesh Mohan**(2001),
- **Sam Pitroda**(2012)
- **Bibek Debroy**(2015).

- - **Bibek Debroy committee in 2015 has noted that “departmentalism” is a major problem in the system.** Most committees have said merger of the services in some form would be a solution. **It recommended merging of all services to create two distinct services: Technical and Logistics.**
  - A separate exam under the Union Public Service Commission is proposed to be instituted in 2021 to induct IRMS officers.

**Restructured Board:**

- The Board will now consist of **five members –** Chairman, who will act as a CEO, along with four members responsible for infrastructure, operations and business development, rolling stock, and finance.
- There will also be a **Directorate-General – Human Resources (DG – HR)** under the Chairman. The Board will also have some independent members, who will be highly distinguished professionals.
- The **eight railway services** will be **integrated** into a central service called the **Indian Railway Management Service (IRMS).** All employees at the management level will come into the Railways through one service — the IRMS.

The Indian Railways is organized into service departments such as traffic, civil, mechanical, electrical, signal & telecom, stores, personnel, and accounts.

**Restructured Board**

- The Railways will also **upgrade the 27 General Managers (GMs)**working at zonal levels to secretary-level grade – highest in the government of India.
- The integration of service departments will **cut the clutter in decision making and** organize the working of the Railway Board and its zones along more commercial lines. This will also **end departmentalism.**

The lack of coordination between the maintenance and traffic staff is said to have played a role in the Khatauli rail mishap near Muzaffarnagar in August 2017.

It will streamline railway operations and provide flexibility to the way Railways deploy people. It is a **step towards corporatization.**

**Issues**

- Merging all 8,400 officers in the eight services — five technical and three non-technical — to prepare a common seniority list and a general pool of posts, especially in higher managerial ranks.
- Those protesting the government’s decision say that the merger is unscientific and against established norms because it proposes to merge two fundamentally dissimilar entities, with multiple disparities.
- First, the civil servants come from all walks of life after clearing the Civil Services Examination. The engineers usually sit for the Engineering Services Examination right after getting an engineering degree. Various studies have noted that engineers join the Railways around the age of 22-23, while the civil servants join when they are around 26, barring exceptions. The age difference starts to pinch at the later stages of their careers when higher-grade posts are fewer. There are more engineers than civil servants.
- Protesters are also saying that the merger is against the service conditions which civil servants sign up for while choosing an alternative if they cannot make it to IAS.

**Issues in Railways**

**Service Quality is not up to the mark**

1.  **Cross Subsidization issue**

The working of Indian Railways is caught up between making it a self-sufficient organization and serving it as a transport system for the poor. The result being no rise in passenger fares and new trains and routes being decided on non-commercial reasons. The passenger fares usually remain static for years, burdening the Union Budget. In order to keep finances in check, freight charges have been raised in the past. But the discrepancy between freight charges and passenger fares seem to distort the Railways’ performance.

2.  Overburdening of the Railway infrastructure due to heavy passenger load. There laying of new tracks is at slow speed. There is little capital expenditure on the railways.
3.  The number of stranded projects are also high in Railways.
4.  Quality of food served to passengers by the Indian railways is not satisfying.

- Dirty Blankets for AC compartments
- There are rising complaints over unclean toilets and sanitation accessories provided to the passengers.
- **Charges –**Railways were levying a surcharge for journey on “superfast” trains when these often ran late.
- **Redressal mechanism –**The complaints raised by passengers on different issues are not addressed properly by the authorities.

**Measures proposed**

- **Freight –**New operational setups in logistics like private players will improve the business.
- Smaller cargoes need to be targeted and door-to-door delivery with the cooperation of logistics companies will help.
- Dedicated freight corridors will simultaneously address both the needs of freight and passenger traffic.
- **Tariffs –**The passenger services should be made affordable by raising Industrial freight rates.
- There is a need for a regulator to recommend fare rises and pricing decisions.
- **Food –**To immediately address the issue of poor quality food, food can be made optional so passengers can bring their own food and get a discount.
- **Amenities –**On blankets, a pilot has been launched to raise minimum temperatures under air conditioning and stop supplying blankets.
- There are also reports that the National Institute of Fashion Technology will design light blankets which can be cleaned easily but the immediate reaction is to downgrade the product.

### Roads and road transport system in India

India has the second-largest road network in the world, Total Road Length – – 6.4 million km (comprises of national & state highways and urban & rural roads).

**Importance –**

- - Transportation of goods – 64.5% by road.
  - Passenger traffic – 90% by road.

National highways account for 2% of the total road network and carry over 40% of total traffic. Highway construction in India increased at 17.00% CAGR between FY16-FY21. Despite pandemic and lockdown, India has constructed 13,298 km of highways in FY21. In FY21, 13,298 kms of highway was constructed across India.

**Government push towards Road Infrastructure**

1.  National Infrastrcture pipeline – Rs. 111 lakh crore allocated for FY 2019-25 The roads sector is likely to account for 18% capital expenditure over FY 2019-25.
2.  India has a well-developed framework for Public-Private-Partnerships (PPP) in the highway sector. Asian Development Bank ranked India at the first spot in PPP operational maturity and also designated India as a developed market for PPPs.
3.  Bharatmala Pariyojana, –  aims to build 66,100 km of economic corridors, border and coastal roads, and expressways to boost the highway network.
4.  The market for roads and highways is projected to exhibit a CAGR of 36.16% during 2016-2025
5.  Almost 40% (824) of the 1,824 PPP projects awarded in India until December 2019 were related to roads.
6.  The highways sector in India has been at the forefront of performance and innovation. The government has successfully rolled out over 60 projects worth over $10 bn based on the Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM). HAM has balanced risk appropriately between private and public partners and boosted PPP activity in the sector.
7.  **Data Lake and Project Management Software** – NHAI has become ‘Fully Digital’, with the launch of unique cloud based and Artificial Intelligence powered Big Data Analytics platform. The entire project management work flow of NHAI is transformed from manual to online portal based, wherein the complete project execution operations including ‘workflow with time lines’ and ‘alert mechanism’ have been configured. All project documentation, contractual decisions and approvals are now being done through portal only.
8.  2021-22 Budget recognises this need with a significant budgetary outlay for the road transport and highways sector of ₹1,18,101 crore

**Bharatmala Project Components**

Phase I—24,800 km of fresh roads and 10,000 km of roads subsumed from the National Highways Development Project—by 2022, at a cost of ₹5.35 lakh crore.

- **Economic Corridor** –construction of 9000kms of Economic Corridors will be undertaken by the central government.
- **Feeder Route or Inter Corridor** – of 6000km will be constructed.
- **National Corridor Efficiency Improvement** – 5000kms of roads, constructed under the scheme will fall in the category of National Corridor for the better connection between roads.
- **Border Road and International Connectivity** – for Connecting the cities and remote areas, which are situated in the border regions, (constructing 2000kms roads that fall in the Border Road or International Connectivity category).
- **Port Connectivity and Coastal Road** – length 2000 km
- **Green Field Expressway** – The main stress will be given on the construction and development of Green Field Expressway for better management of traffic and freight.
- **Balance NHDP Works** – Under the last segment, the project will see construction and maintenance of about 10,000kms of new roads.

**Challenges**

1.  Land acquisition that can cost at least 25 to 30 percent of every project; there can be projects where it is even higher than the cost of construction. It not only escalates overall project costs, but also causes enormous delays :-
    - In a study conducted by NHAI on 106 projects, worth over ₹1.5 billion, facing implementation delays, issues pertaining to land acquisition were identified as one of the important causes for the delay in almost 50 percent of the projects. Besides, about 5 percent of these projects were delayed exclusively because of land acquisition issues
    - The government’s burden to acquire land has risen in compliance with the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, that mandates it to pay four times the market value of acquired land in rural areas and two times in urban areas
2.  Development of the road network continues to be plagued by delays
    1.  - over 800 road projects for a cumulative of more than 27,000 km, under the MoRTH, as being delayed.
        - Bharatmala Pariyojana – Phase I, which is crucial to coastal and port connectivity, and which was targeted to be completed in 2021-22 has been delayed to 2025-26, with both awards and completion under this project being far behind deadlines.
3.  MoRTH’s lack of any source of revenue other than budgetary support from the Central government and borrowings.
4.  Private participation could be challenging due to the continued stretched balance sheets of many infrastructure developers
5.  Very limited private sector participation in development of new roads and highways. This is driven by the financial profile of the developers, a lack of debt products that can be aligned to revenue models of highway projects as well as by delays in land acquisition, and an uncertain regulatory framework
6.  Since most of the projects are to be constructed in remote areas, mobilization of equipment and raw materials would be challenging. A slew of measures such as enhancement of approval limit of projects by the NHAI to Rs 2,000 crore from Rs 1,000 crore, increase in compensation rates to farmers under the new land acquisition policy and digitalization of land acquisitions would expedite projects under Bharatmala

**Way forward**

1.  Given the extent of capital commitment and outlay required to augment and maintain the road network over the next few years, there is a need to diversify sources of funds beyond budgetary allocation and borrowings by NHAI. This need for diversification becomes even more pronounced in the context of the nearly ₹97,000 crore debt service liability of NHAI over the next three financial years.
2.  NHAI’s Infrastructure Investment Trust (In VIT), which was approved in December 2019 will be launched soon. It also appears that NHAI’s operational toll roads, are likely to form a significant part of the national asset monetization program, with the Minister suggesting that NHAI plans to monetize ₹1,00,000 crore under the ToT model in the next 5 years.
3.  The newly announced DFI too will, hopefully, play a major role in making viable debt available for road network development.
4.  government should also revisiting its PPP models (including its HAM model) to attract more private sector investment in new asset development.
5.  implementation of Bharatmala would depend on fast tracking of land acquisitions, clearances from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and other clearances.
6.  Timely redressal of disputes by establishing a regulator is also crucial before undertaking such a large-scale project because of possible arbitration issues,

Eventually, strong transport infrastructure is essential to economic growth. A robust road network will be one important pillar in India’s speedy economic recovery and one would hope that the government’s budgetary commitment to strengthening roadway infrastructure is accompanied by attractive private investment opportunities in the sector.

### Water transport in India

Water transport is the cheapest and the oldest mode of transport. It operates on a natural track and hence does not require huge capital investment in the construction and maintenance of its track except in case of canals. The cost of operation of water transport is also very less. It has the largest carrying capacity and is most suitable for carrying bulky goods over long distances. It has played a very significant role in bringing different parts of the world closer and is indispensable to foreign trade.

Kinds of Water Transport:

**Water transport consists of:**

1.  Inland water transport
2.  Ocean transport:

**Inland water transport**

They are artificial waterways made for the purpose of irrigation or navigation or both. Canal transport requires a huge amount of capital investment in construction and maintenance of its track i.e., the artificial waterways. The cost of the canal transport is, therefore, higher than that of river transport. To add to it, the cost of providing water for the canals is also a very big problem of canal transport.

**Advantages:**

**1\. Low Cost:**

Rivers are a natural highway which does not require any cost of construction and maintenance. Even the cost of construction and maintenance of canals is much less or they are used, not only for transport purposes but also for irrigation, etc. Moreover, the cost of operation of the inland water transport is very low. Thus, it is the cheapest mode of transport for carrying goods from one place to another.

**2\. Larger Capacity:**

It can carry much larger quantities of heavy and bulky goods such as coal, and, timber etc.

**3\. Flexible Service:**

It provides much more flexible service than railways and can be adjusted to individual requirements.

**4\. Safety:**

The risks of accidents and breakdowns, in this form of transport, are minimum as compared to any other form of transport.

**Disadvantages:**

**1\. Slow:**

Speed of Inland water transport is very slow and therefore this mode of transport is unsuitable where time is an important factor.

**2\. Limited Area of Operation:**

It can be used only in a limited area which is served by deep canals and rivers.

3**. Seasonal Character:**

Rivers and canals cannot be operated for transportation throughout the year as water may freeze during winter or water level may go very much down during summer.

**4\. Unreliable:**

The inland water transport by rivers is unreliable. Sometimes the river changes its course which causes dislocation in the normal route of the trade.

**5\. Unsuitable for Small Business:**

Inland water transport by rivers and canals is not suitable for small traders, as it takes normally a longer time to carry goods from one place to another through this form of transport.

**Ocean transport:**

Ocean transport is indispensable for foreign trade. It has brought the different parts of the world closer and has knitted together all the nations of the world into one big world market. It operates on a natural track, i.e., the sea and does not require any investment in the construction and maintenance of its track. It is, obviously, the cheapest mode of transport.

**Ocean transport includes:**

1.  Coastal Shipping
2.  Overseas Shipping

**1\. Coastal Shipping:**

It is one of the most important means of transport for carrying goods from one part to another in a country. It is a cheaper and quicker mode of transport and is most suitable for carrying heavy, bulky and cheap traffic like coal, iron ore, etc. to distant places. But it can serve only limited areas. Earlier, coastal shipping in India was mainly in the hands of foreign shipping companies. But now from 1951 onwards, it is exclusively reserved for Indian ships.

**2\. Overseas Shipping:**

There are three types of vessels employed in the overseas shipping:

(i) Liners,

(ii) Tramps,

(iii) Tankers.

**(i) Liners:**

Liners are the ships which have regular fixed routes, time and charges. They are, usually, a collection of vessels under one ownership, i.e., a fleet. They provide a uniform and regular service. Liners sail on scheduled dates and time, whether full of cargo or not.

**(ii) Tramps:**

Tramps are ships which have no fixed routes. They have no set rules or rate schedule. Usually, they do not sail till they have full cargo. They can be chartered by exporters and are ready to sail anywhere and at any time. They are not as fast in speed as liners. Tramps are more suitable to carry seasonal and bulky goods.

**(iii) Tankers:**

Tankers are the vessels which are specially designed to carry oil, petrol and such other liquids. They have a large capacity, 2 to 3 lakh tons of oil, and very shortly, we may have super tankers with a capacity of about 10 lakh tons of oil.

**Advantages:**

1.  It operates on a natural track as sea provides a readymade ‘road bed’ for the ships to sail. Hence, it does not require huge amount of capital investment in the construction and maintenance of its track.
2.  Due to the smooth surface of sea, comparatively less tractive power is required for its operation which results in a lesser cost of operation. Thus, it is the cheapest mode of transport.
3.  It has the largest carrying capacity as compared to any other transport.
4.  The risk of damage in transit of the goods is also less as compared to other modes of transport. But the goods are exposed to the ‘perils of sea’.
5.  It is the only suitable mode of transport for carrying heavy and bulky goods to distant places.
6.  It is indispensable to foreign trade.

**Water Transport India**

Around 95% of India’s trading by volume and 70% by value is done through maritime transport.

India has 12 major and 205 notified minor and intermediate ports. Under the National Perspective Plan for Sagarmala, six new mega ports will be developed in the country.

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) of up to 100% under the automatic route for port and harbour construction and maintenance projects. It has also facilitated a 10-year tax holiday to enterprises that develop, maintain and operate ports, inland waterways and inland ports.

India’s key ports had a capacity of 1,534.91 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) in FY20. In FY21, all key ports in India handled 672.60 million tonnes (MT) of cargo traffic.

Merchandise exports reached US$ 255.92 billion in FY21 (until February 2021).

- India is expected to begin full operations in Iran’s Chabahar Port by the end of May 2021. India is building two terminals at the port and will operate them for 10 years
- In Union Budget 2020-21, the total allocation for the Ministry of Shipping was Rs. 1,702.35 crore (US$ 233.48 million).
- The Finance Minister proposed to double the ship recycling capacity of ~4.5 million light displacement tonnes (LDT) by 2024; this is expected to generate an additional ~1.5 lakh employment opportunities in India.
- In Union Budget 2021, the government announced subsidy funding worth Rs. 1,624 crore (US$ 222.74 million) to Indian shipping companies to encourage merchant ship flagging in the country.
- in February 2021, the Major Port Authorities Bill, 2020 was passed by the Parliament of India. The bill aims to decentralise decision-making and reinforce excellence in major port governance.

**Major Ports Authorities Bill 2020**

1.  The Bill provides for the regulation of major ports and will replace the Major Port Trusts Act of 1963,
2.  The Bill will apply to the major ports of
    1.  Chennai,
    2.  Cochin,
    3.  Jawaharlal Nehru Port,
    4.  Kandla,
    5.  Kolkata,
    6.  Mumbai,
    7.  New Mangalore,
    8.  Mormugao,
    9.  Paradip,
    10. VO Chidambaranar
    11. Vishakhapatnam.
3.  The Bill provides for the creation of a Board of Major Port Authority for each major port. It will replace the port Port trust provided by the former act. It will have a member each from the state governments, the Railways Ministry, the defense ministry, and the customs department.
4.  Board will have financial power – To meet its capital and working expenditure requirements, the Board may raise loans from any scheduled bank or financial institution within India, or any financial institution outside India.
5.  The Board will determine these rates for services that will be performed at ports. At present, the Tariff Authority for Major Ports fixes the scale of rates for assets and services available at ports.
6.  Under the new Bill, any person contravening any provision of the Bill or any rules or regulations will be punished with a fine of up to Rs one lakh.

**Challenges faced in respect of existing ports include**

1.  inadequate road networks within the port area,
2.  inadequate cargo-handling equipment and machinery,
3.  inefficiency due to poor hinterland connectivity through rail, road, highways, coastal shipping and inland waterways,
4.  inadequate navigational aids, facilities and IT systems,
5.  insufficient dredging capacity,
6.  lack of technical expertise and
7.  a lack of equipment for handling large volumes.
8.  The turnaround time at ports in India therefore remains abysmal.

**Government initiatives**  
1\. Sagarmala program  
It focuses on modernizing and developing ports, enhancing port connectivity, supporting coastal communities, and stimulating port-linked industrialization. Sagarmala aims  
to reduce the logistics costs for foreign and domestic trade. It also aims to double the share of water transportation in the modal mix.

![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Government-initiatives.jpg)

1.     **Jal Marg Vikas project**

Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP) is a project for the development of National Waterways in India. JMVP was implemented as an initiative towards national integration with an aim to reduce rail and road congestion, carbon footprint, and minimal resource depletion.

2.     **Central Road and Infrastructure Fund**

The Ministry of Finance has amended the Central Road Fund Act, 2000 to include a list of projects and infrastructure sub-sectors, including inland waterways, for which the CRF could be used. The CRF has since been renamed the Central Road and Infrastructure Fund.

**Way forward**

The government needs to open up the dredging market to attract more players, particularly international players, in dredging activities to increase and maintain draft depth at ports to attract large vessels and enable them to become hub ports.

Expedite the completion of various projects under Sagarmala, especially those aimed at improving port connectivity, setting up coastal economic zones (CEZs), and establishing new ports.

Financing for inland vessels could be made part of priority sector lending by banks.

The setting up of a single-window facility for cargo clearance and putting in place fully mechanized cargo handling infrastructure will be critical to increase throughput.

Enhance technology use in ports and, wherever feasible, draw lessons from successful global ports such as Rotterdam, Felixstowe, and Singapore to improve efficiency.

Inland transport

- As per the National Waterways Act, 2016, 111 have been declared as National Waterways (NW)
- These waterways pass through 24 states and two union territories, with an approximate total length of 20274 km
- These proposed waterways will pass through nearly 138 river systems, creeks, estuaries and related canal systems of India.

**Advantages of Inland Waterways:**

1.  **Cost savings:**
2.  Fuel and Energy Efficient: It is fuel-efficient compared to the other modes of transport, rail and road. For example, the Integrated National Waterways Transportation Grid Study states that one litre of fuel will move 24 tons through one kilometre on road, 85 on rail and 105 km on inland water transport. Further, 1 HP can 150 kg on road, 500 kg on rail and 4000 kg on water.
3.  Cost of developing waterways is much lower than rail & road.
4.  Reduces transportation and transition losses
5.  **Environment Friendly:**
6.  Least fuel consumption per tonne‐km
7.  Carbon dioxide emission is 50% of trucks
8.  Negligible land requirement as compared to rail and road transport
9.  **Supplementary Mode:**
10. Reduces pressure on road and rail
11. Reduces congestion and accidents on road
12. **Optimal Modal Mix:**It will provide optimal modal mix by converging river transport with other modes
13. **Better connectivity:**It help create seamless interconnectivity connecting hinterlands along navigable river coasts and coastal routes. Further, riverine routes are likely to play a crucial role in connecting the north-eastern states to the mainland
14. Inland Waterways hold huge potential for **domestic cargo transport, cruise, tourism and passenger traffic.**
15. Development of inland waterways will help in the **generation of job opportunities**

**Disadvantages of Inland waterways:**

1.  Inland waterways have **low transport speed**thus not suitable where time is an important factor
2.  It has **limited area of operation**, depending on the infrastructural premises and depth of the waterways
3.  There are only very few casesin which Inland water transport (IWT) can offer **door-to-door transport of cargo**
4.  **Operational disruptionsdue to weather**is a major disadvantage

**_Legislation:_**

**1.The Inland Waterways Authority of India Act, 1985:**

The Act provides for the constitution of an Authority for the regulation and development of inland waterways for purposes of shipping and navigation and for matters related to it

The Inland Waterways Authority of India was formed in 1986. It undertakes projects for development and maintenance of IWT infrastructure on national waterways through grant received from Ministry of Shipping

2.  **Indian Vessels Act of 1917 (amended in 2007**): It deals with the survey and registration of inland vessels, removal of obstructions in navigation, carriage of goods and passengers, prevention and control of pollution etc.
3.  **Inland Water Transport Policy 2001:**Policy talks about IWT being economic, fuel-efficient and environment friendly mode of transport. It advocates large-scale private sector participation both for creation of infrastructure and for fleet operations.
4.  **National Waterways Act 2016**

The Act declared 111 rivers or river stretches, creeks, estuaries as National (inland) Waterways.

It enables the Central Government to regulate these waterways for development with regard to shipping, navigation and transport through mechanically propelled vessels.

5.**Laws related to environmental and other impacts:**

Forest Act 1980,

Environmental Protection Act 1986 and various notifications under it like EIA Notification 2006, CRZ Notification 2011

**_Initiatives:_**

1.  **Jal Marg Vikas Project:** Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP) aims at capacity augmentation of navigation on National Waterway-1 (NW-1).The project is being implemented by GOI with technical assistance and investment support of the World Bank.
2.  **Sagarmala Project:** Along with development of coast shipping routes, the project seeks to inland waterways to drive industrial development. It aims to reduce the logistics costs by doubling the share of domestic waterways in the modal mix from current 6 per cent (PIB)
3.  **Interlinking of Rivers Programme:** The project is expected to offer potential benefits to the transport sector through navigation.

**Issues and Challenges**

1.  1.  **Cost estimation:** In respect to operating costs per ton-km, IWT has lower cost than rail and road transport. However, this cost argument is challengeable. There are two factors which distinguishes how freight moves on land versus on water: i) A road travels straight while rivers bend and curve; therefore the difference between freight costs for IWT and road/ railways is not much ii) Cost of loading and unloading freight
2.  Inadequate depth:To be viable for a navigable inland waterway, river needs enough depth throughout the year However, in their natural state; many Indian rivers simply do not have that level of water which will necessitate extensive dredging. Moreover, Indian rivers (especially rivers in the northern plains) face severe problems of siltation round the year
3.  **Impact on other activities:** Water in rivers has competing demands, including dams and farming. To maintain the water levels in the river to the degree needed for them to function as inland waterways, the water use for such other activities might get curbed.
4.  **Inadequate Air Draft:** Multiple bridges with low vertical clearance obstruct the passage of bigger inland water transport vessels on many inland waterways such as NW 3
5.  **Lack of night navigation infrastructure:** Rudimentary night navigational facilities and markings are also a major issue.
6.  Shortage of IWT vessels: Vessel building is highly capital intensive and faces difficulties in obtaining project finance from banks and financial institutions.
7.  Shortage of MRO facilities: There is severe shortage of MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) facilities for IWT vessels.
8.  Inadequate industries: Inadequate number of Industrial units on the riverside, especially not along the Brahmaputra is a major discouragement hindering development of inland waterways. At National Policy Dialogue on transboundary cooperation related to the Ganga and the Brahmaputra rivers – states, it was highlighted that due to inadequate industrial units result in no cargo commitments by the private players
9.  **Lack of funds**: Dredging as well as infrastructure for IWT requires huge investments. However, both public and private funding in the sector is low
10. **Environmental Impact:**

Dredging operations will damage river bed, and can lead to change in habitats for various aquatic flora and fauna.

Dredging may also impact aquifers along the river, damaging the ability of water to percolate underground.

In estuaries and creeks of rivers the removal of river bed material during capital dredging can result in the ingress of excess saline water into the creek or rivers. This is one of the reasons why the state of Kerala had opposed many of its proposed waterways

Construction of jetties, river ports will necessitate removal of trees/ mangrove forests in the area. For example, At Dharamtar port in NW10, for construction of a jetty, the mangrove forest belt on the bank has been removed

Other environmental concerns include pollution due to oil and diesel from vessels, leakage and spilling of cargo

Note: Dredging is an excavation or digging activity carried out underwater that removes rock, mud, silt, sediments etc. from the bottom of the river bed or other water bodies. Dredging is used to dig and create a channel in the river bed of the required depth.

11.**Social impact:**

Ecological impacts can have implications for livelihoods of people dependent on the rivers and creeks. For example: impact on fishing community, people dependent on riverbed cultivation

Displacement is another major concern as land is needed for number of facilities like ports, jetties, and other infrastructure.

![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Social-impact.jpg)

**NITI Aayog Recommendations (Action Agenda, Three-Year2017-2020)**

**1.Streamline the governance of inland waterways:** NITI Aayog recommends streamlining the regulatory structure and bringing an overarching body to oversee Inland Water Transport such as the IWAI to more consistency in the rules and strategy of the sector.

2.**Develop measures for year-round navigation:**

Efforts should be made to develop deeper stretches of the river, i.e., at least 2.5 m to 3 m to achieve year-around navigation adequate maintenance of rivers, including continuous dredging to maintain adequate water depth for servicing shipping lines should be ensured

3.**Ease restrictions on river-sea movement:** Utilizing a single vessel for both inland and coastal waters, lowers transport costs and minimizes handling. Thus, by 2020, state authorities should draw up coordinates for inland vessel limits under the Inland Vessel Act for their coastal waters

4.**Develop inland waterways transport to facilitate movement of goods to neighbouring countries and the Northeast:**

By 2018, state governments should commence work on dredging and channel stabilization to create about 20 new ports in the Brahmaputra and Barak rivers.

The protocol for Inland Waterways between Bangladesh and India should be extended for at least 10 years to reduce uncertainty.

### Civil Aviation in India

**Importance**

The Indian aviation industry which contributed five percent of GDP, offers four million jobs and another seven million jobs through tourism and related activities. So more efforts are needed, on creating infrastructure which will enable further growth.

India’s passenger traffic stood at 115.37 million in FY21.

Domestic passenger and international passenger traffic declined at a CAGR of -9.02% and -28.64%, respectively, from FY16 to FY21, owing to COVID-19-related restrictions on flights in FY21.

In FY21, airports in India pegged the domestic passenger traffic to be ~105.2 million, a 61.7% YoY decline, and international passenger traffic to be ~10.1 million, an 84.8% YoY decline, over the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.

Aircraft movement declined at a CAGR of -7.79% from 1.60 million in FY16 to 1.20 million in FY21. From FY16 to FY21, domestic aircraft movement decreased at a CAGR of -6.44% and international aircraft movement declined at a CAGR of -18.52%. India’s domestic and international aircraft movements reached 1,062 thousand and 135 thousand, respectively, in FY21.The expenditure of Indian travellers is expected to grow to Rs. 9.5 lakh crore (US$ 136 billion) by 2021.

**Challenges**

1.  **Increase in fuel prices**  
    Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) is an important deciding factor in cost of operation in Aviation Industry Jet fuel accounts for 45 percent of an airline’s cost of operation.
2.  **MRO – maintenance and repair is costly.**

Other than ATF, the other large expense item for airlines is the maintenance and repair (MRO) of aircraft.

Maintenance and repair taxation in India remains the highest globally. With an 18 percent GST levy, providers have to compete on sale price with overseas players that only pay 5 percent — that too at cost price. This gap: 20-22 percent. Consequently, most airlines contract their maintenance overseas, leading to a loss of jobs and output.

MRO setups are capital intensive and require significant investment in terms of infrastructure, material, training of manpower and technology.

The National Civil Aviation policy (NCAP 2016) attempted in part to address this issue by limiting the royalty and additional charges and mandating that these not be levied on MRO service providers for a date of five years from the date of approval of the policy. Yet, the royalty is still being imposed under different classifications ranging from 11 percent to 30 percent.

3.  **Government interference is hurdles in growth**

India government should follows aviation industry free from policy hurdles like regulating airfares and slash taxes, including jet fuel.

Government to focus on building infrastructure and the air navigation system.

4.  **Higher airport cost**

Airport (aeronautical) Charges levied by Airport Authority of India are higher. According to a latest survey, the airport charges levied by the Indian airports (Domestic and International Terminal) are amongst the highest in the Asian and the Gulf countries. This adds more burden to aviation companies.

5.  **Severe competition affecting financial viability of Airlines**

Established Airlines are threatened by low cost carriers, which are eating up their market share. In order to consolidate their market share, top premium airlines were forced to reduce their ticket fares to around 15- 20 per cent. Such a slash down in price will lead to a price war in the long run amongst the airlines with the only goal of increasing their market share.

6.  banks are extremely reluctant to lend to aviation. The reasons are many, including fluctuating EBITDAs, weak balance sheets, systemic impacts of crisis with Airlines like Jet Airways and the NPA cleanup.

7.  **Foreign Investments**

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows in air transport has been low due to FDI limits. Between 2000-17, FDI was around US$ 1,608.51 million.

FDI limits has now been raise to 100% under automatic route in scheduled air transport service, regional air transport service and domestic scheduled passenger airline.

8.  **Air safety**

In the past few years, there have been a number of fatal accidents snuffing out hundreds of innocent lives. Many of these accidents could have been avoided if as the planners, managers and regulators had a better understanding of the dynamics of the man-machine interface.

9.  Airport Infrastructure

Major focus is on developing terminals, while addition of new runways has been out of focus. The number of runways has not increased (with the exception of Delhi airport). New runways that are to come up are years away. For airlines this means that they are forced to fly unviable routes. And for passengers this means that fares in constrained airports will inevitably rise.

The country has a total of 449 airports but metro airports dominate in terms of aviation traffic with about 61 percent of the domestic traffic and about 73 percent of international traffic still originating from the six metros — Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Chennai.

With the exception of Bengaluru, which will see the addition of an additional runway this year, the capacity expansion at other airports lags or is non-existent.

**Key investments and developments**

1.  Rs 15,000 crore (US$ 2.32 billion) have allotted for expanding existing terminals and constructing 15 new ones will be made through the Airport Authority of India (AAI).
2.  Government of India has signed an agreement with Australia allowing airlines on either side to offer unlimited seats to six Indian metro cities and various Australian cities.
3.  Guwahati Airport will be designated as an inter-regional hub and Agartala, Imphal and Dibrugarh as intra-regional hubs.
4.  Allocation to Civil Aviation Ministry has been increased to Rs 6,602.86 crore (US$ 1,019.9 million) under Union Budget 2018-19.
5.  The government has launched the construction of Navi Mumbai airport which is expected to be built at a cost of US$ 2.58 billion. The first phase of the airport will be completed by the end of 2019.
6.  The Government of Andhra Pradesh is planning to develop Greenfield airports in six cities-Nizamabad, Nellore, Kurnool, Ramagundam, Tadepalligudem and Kothagudem under the PPP model.

**Reforms Under Atma-Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan**

1.  **Improving Airspace Management**

**Route dispersal guidelines (RDG),** mandates airlines to fly a certain percentage of flights in smaller, unprofitable air routes. The government announced that these restrictions on the utilisation of Indian airspace will be eased. This will lead to optimal utilization of airspace and reduction in fuel use.

2.  **Airports Development through PPP**

6 more airports will be auctioned under the Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) model for their development.

3.  **Global Hub for Aircraft Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul**

The government intends to make India a global hub for **Aircraft Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) services.**

It will result in saving costs and creating liquidity for airline companies.

Also, the convergence between the Defence sector and the civil MROs will be established to bring down the maintenance cost of airlines.

**The following are its salient features:**

- Duration- 10 years
- Selection of Airline through a competitive bidding process
- The Central government will provide the following:
  - Subsidy to cover Value Gap funding (VGF) for participating airlines
  - Concessional GST on tickets booked using the scheme
  - Code sharing for flights under the policy
- State Governments will extend the following measures:
  - GST reduction to 1% for 10 years
  - Coordination with oil companies to facilitate refueling facilities
  - Provide land for airport and ancillary development
  - Trained security personnel
  - Utilities at subsidized rates
  - 20% of VGF
- Airport operators such as AAI will provide the following concessions:
  - No parking, landing and storage charges at participating airports
  - Nil TNLC (Terminal Navigation Landing Charges)
  - Allow ground handling by the airline selected through the bidding process
  - RNCF (Route Navigation and Facilitation Charges) will be discounted to 42.4% of normal rates by the Airports Authority of India

Value Gap Funding is not provided to cargo airlines. All other terms and conditions remain the same as passenger airlines. The fares are graded based on distance and flight hours for both fixed-wing and rotary-wing services.

The RCS subsidy is funded by a levy of Rs 5000 per flight on major routes. Flights regulated under this policy framework can be booked from the UDAN website and major travel portals by passengers.

**Challenges**

- **Infrastructure**–

  - Building a greenfield airport isn’t enough, unless flights are able to take off and land.
  - Weather conditions make it difficult for flights to land on the airports located on mountainous terrains on most days.
  - Also, lack of instrument landing systems (ILS) lead to flight cancellations and the repeated cancellations make it difficult to build traffic on the route on a sustained basis.

- **Traffic route** –

  - While the infra challenge might be easier to fix, the bigger challenge is putting in place an ideal network design.
  - Thus, the key is to discover routes where there is sustained traffic, not just in a few months of the year, but all round the year.
  - To generate steady, predictable traffic, a hub and spoke design should be followed by connecting the large metro airports to the new Udan routes, as opposed to a point-to-point service.

- **Capacity** –

  - India’s metro airports are largely choked and they have already run out of capacity in terms of landing and parking slots.
  - Also, passenger traffic in these airports continues to gallop at nearly 18-20% every year.
  - To manage these traffic, the existing airlines have responded by ordering aircraft that could almost double the existing aircraft capacity in another three years.
  - This will stretch India’s airport capacity in the metros even further.
  - Though the Udan routes was intended to help manage this traffic flow from metro routes, it affects more from this rise in air traffic.
  - This is because, the airport operators are expected to waive off landing and parking charges on these routes and thus more airlines are expected to ply on these routes.

- **Time slots** –
  - Subsequently, finding convenient time slots for every route will become an administrative challenge.
  - This is because, the number of runways is not increasing in high traffic airports and the airport capacity lag the passenger traffic growth.
  - Especially, the new regional airlines have faced a major challenge in connecting the metro airports to the new Udan routes, since they don’t have pre-existing slots in them.
  - This has made these regional operators difficult to start operations for more than a year, which has also resulted in their licenses getting stripped off later.

**Way Forward**

1.  **Enhance Aviation Infrastructure**

Ongoing projects under the **UDAN initiative** need to be completed in a time-bound manner.

In addition, the existing capacity of international airports should be augmented under the **International UDAN in\*\***i\***\*tiative**.

2.  Long term plan need to be formulated for advanced research in aviation technologies. It will help in creating a manufacturing ecosystem in the country
3.  **Address Shortage of Skilled Manpower**

There is a need for promotion of collaboration between original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), industry and educational institutes to assimilate the latest technology and management practices in the aviation industry.

4.  **Augmenting Finances**

Taxation and pricing structure of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) should be aligned to global benchmarks by considering bringing under the ambit of GST.

Vacant real estate near **Airports Authority of India (AAI) airports** in all major centres can be monetised to increase non-aeronautical revenues.

5.  **Making India a Transhipment Hub**

India can reap multiple benefits by establishing itself as a transhipment hub in the region. This will augment India’s trading capacity as a service provider, emerging as a foreign exchange earner and enabler for better connectivity in the region.

This may be done by the development of digital business enablers such as e-contracting, e-transportation multimodality, e-compliances and an e-grievance redressal module.

In this context, the **National Civil Aviation Policy 2016** and National Civil Aviation program 2018 can help India to become a major civil aviation market in the world.

### Communication Infrastructure in India

- Currently, India is the **world’s second-largest** telecommunications market with a subscriber base of 1.16 billion and has registered strong growth in the last decade
- The **liberal and reformist policies** of the Government of India have been instrumental, along with strong consumer demand in the rapid growth in the Indian telecom sector
- India’s digital economy generates approximately $200 billion annually from information technology (IT) and business process management (IT-BPM), IT-enabled services (ITeS), E-Commerce, electronics manufacturing, digital payments, and digital communication services
  - India aims to reach a **$1 trillion digital economy** and a **$5 trillion GDP** by 2025
  - Currently, the Information and Communication technology sector is the key driver of economy, and contributes over 13% to India’s GDP
- The **deregulation of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)** norms have made the sector one of the fastest growing and the top five employment opportunity generator in the country

**Growth**

- Over the next five years, rise in mobile-phone penetration and decline in data costs, will add 500 million new internet users in India, creating opportunities for new businesses.
- According to a Zenith Media survey, India is expected to become the **fastest-growing telecom advertisement market**, with an annual growth rate of 11% between 2020 and 2023

**Issues/Challenges related to communication Infrastructure in India**

- **Limited Spectrum Availability**: Available spectrum is less than 40% as compared to European nations and 50% as compared to China
- **Declining Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**: ARPU decline now is sharp along with falling profits and in some cases serious losses, is prompting the Indian telecom industry to look at consolidation as the only way to boost revenues’
- **Other issues include**:
  - The telecom industry is reeling under a **debt of over ₹4 lakh crore** and has been seeking a relief package from the government
  - **Lack of Telecom Infrastructure in Semi-rural and Rural areas**: Service providers have to incur huge initial fixed cost to enter semi-rural and rural areas. Key reasons behind these costs are lack of basic infrastructure like power and roads, resulting in delays in rolling out the infrastructure.
- Lack of trained personnel to operate and maintain the cellular infrastructure is another challenge

**Measures taken by Government to boost Communication Infrastructure in India**

- **FDI cap in** the telecom sector has been increased to 100% from 74%
  - FDI of up to 100% is permitted for infrastructure providers offering dark fibre, electronic mail and voice mail
- In 2020, the government approved the **Production Incentive Scheme (PLI)** for Large- scale Electronics Manufacturing.
  - The scheme proposes production-linked incentive to boost domestic manufacturing and attract large investments in mobile phone manufacturing and specified electronic components including Assembly, Testing, Marking and Packaging (ATMP) units
- In 2020, the Union Cabinet, approved the provision of **submarine optical fibre cable connectivity** between Mainland (Kochi) and Lakshadweep Islands (KLI Project)
- In 2021, India and Japan signed an MoU to enhance cooperation in the field of Information and Communications Technologies
- Department of Telecommunication launched ‘**Tarang Sanchar**’ – a web portal sharing information on mobile towers and EMF Emission Compliances
- The government has approved a project at a cost of 20,000 crore for creating a **National Optical Fiber Network (NOFN)** which will provide broadband connectivity to 2.5 lakh gram panchayats for various applications like ehealth, e-education, and e-governance.
  - The project is being funded under the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF).
- Also, **A new National Digital Communications Policy – 2018 (NDCP-2018)** was unveiled in 2018 to cater to the modern needs of the digital communications sector of India.
  - The policy aims to attract USD 100 billion worth of investments and generate 4 million jobs in the sector by 2022
- As per the **National Digital Communication Plan**, the Central government has set a target of setting up millions of Wi-Fi hotspots by 2022 and the **PM-WANI scheme** will facilitate this

### Urban infrastructure

Urbanization is an integral part of the process of economic growth. As in most countries, India’s towns and cities make a major contribution to the country’s economy. With less than 1/3 of India’s people, its urban areas generate over 2/3 of the country’s GDP and account for 90% of government revenues.

Urbanization in India has expanded rapidly as increasing numbers of people migrate to towns and cities in search of economic opportunity. Slums now account for 1/4 of all urban housing. In Mumbai, for instance, more than half the population lives in slums, many of which are situated near employment centers in the heart of town, unlike in most other developing countries.

**Fast Facts – Urbanization in India**

- Most Urbanized States: Tamil Nadu 43.9%; Maharashtra 42.4%; Gujarat 37.4%
- 3 out of world’s 21 mega cities: Mumbai (19 mill); Delhi (15 mill); Kolkata (14 mill)
- Large Cities: 23 in 1991; 40 in 2001
- Urban Pop.: 25% of 850 mill in 1992; 28% of 1,030 mill in 2002.
- Estimated Urban Pop. by 2017: 500 mill
- % of Urban Residents who are Poor: About 25%
- Slum Population:  About 41 million in 2001
- Estimated Slum Pop. by 2017: 69 mill

Meeting the needs of India’s soaring urban populations is and will therefore continue to be a strategic policy matter. Critical issues that need to be addressed are:

1.  Poor local governance.
2.  Weak finances.
3.  Inappropriate planning that leads to high costs of housing and office space; in some Indian cities these costs are among the highest in the world.
4.  Critical infrastructure shortages and major service deficiencies that include erratic water and power supply, and woefully inadequate transportation systems.
5.  Rapidly deteriorating environment.

**CHALLENGES**

**Planning:**

1.  Many urban governments lack a modern planning framework.
2.  The multiplicity of local bodies obstructs efficient planning and land use.
3.  Rigid master plans and restrictive zoning regulations limit the land available for building, constricting cities’ abilities to grow in accordance with changing needs.

**Housing:**

- Building regulations that limit urban density – such as floor space indexes – reduce the number of houses available, thereby pushing up property prices
- Outdated rent control regulations reduce the number of houses available on rent – a critical option for the poor
- Poor access to micro finance and mortgage finance limit the ability of low income groups to buy or improve their homes
- Policy, planning, and regulation deficiencies lead to a proliferation of slums
- Weak finances of urban local bodies and service providers leave them unable to expand the trunk infrastructure that housing developers need to develop new sites.

**Service delivery:**

- Most services are delivered by city governments with unclear lines of accountability
- There is a strong bias towards adding physical infrastructure rather than providing financially and environmentally sustainable services
- Service providers are unable to recover operations and maintenance costs and depend on the government for finance
- Independent regulatory authorities that set tariffs, decide on subsidies, and enforce service quality are generally absent.

**Infrastructure:**

- Most urban bodies do not generate the revenues needed to renew infrastructure, nor do they have the creditworthiness to access capital markets for funds
- Urban transport planning needs to be more holistic – there is a focus on moving vehicles rather than meeting the needs of the large numbers of people who walk or ride bicycles in India’s towns and cities.

**Environment:**

- The deteriorating urban environment is taking a toll on people’s health and productivity and diminishing their quality of life.

**Other Infrastructure Bottlenecks in India**

1.  **Financing**

Infrastructure projects are highly capital intensive and funding is considered as a major impediment in achieving the infrastructure goals.

The infrastructure broadly can be divided into two types,

1.  one which is very essential for the public at large and have no or very little revenue potential and
2.  other which has handsome revenue potential.

The first kind of infrastructure must be totally government financed whereas the later can be developed on PPP mode. Since resource constraints will continue to limit public investment in infrastructure, PPP-based development needs to be encouraged wherever feasible.

2.  **Land Acquisition**

Compensation fixed in terms of registered value is always the bone of contention.

There is always a substantial difference between the compensation offered and the actual value of the land. The land owners always feel aggrieved which results in dispute and litigation.

3.  **Clearances from numerous agencies**

Most of the infrastructure projects in India suffer from delays in completion. This is mainly due to an inadequate regulatory framework and inefficiency in the approval process. Infrastructure projects require multiple sequential clearances at various levels of government. There are various approvals needed at every stage which definitely delay the infrastructure projects.

4.  **Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)**

Environmental safeguards and guidelines have proven to be one of the major reasons for delay in infrastructure projects, especially in the power sector. While new projects need to comply with these regulations, even a project under construction may need to comply with revised standards midway through the execution stage.

5.  **Poor pre-construction planning**

Due to the already adverse effect of various impediments like land acquisition, statutory approvals, delayed financial closure, etc. the pre-construction phase of infrastructure projects is pretty long. Therefore, there is delayed commissioning and completion of projects.

Suggestions and Way Forward

India’s Infrastructure which is an essential and most important component of Urban Development, is in a poor shape and needs an immediate attention and redress both from Government and Industry.

6.  There must be a more conducive environment for potential concessionaire. There is always a worry of early clearances and investors are stuck in the bureaucratic cycle.
7.  There is a necessity for improvements in the investment climate.
8.  Migration of large population to urban centers is causing new cities to emerge and existing ones to expand. This is causing rapid urbanization. Therefore, India needs to develop satellite cities for which the need is of mass-transport systems.
9.  There must be Single window statutory clearance which even includes Environmental clearance to projects.
10. There are good competent people working in different departments of government, however they are working in silos, we need better and effective coordination for a fast project roll out.
11. There is no doubt that fiscal support is the dominant factor for infrastructure development but equally important is enabling policies from the governments end. Then only the world class infrastructure dream of India can be realized and place India’s economy on a high growth trajectory.

India has the second largest urban population in the world and by 2050, around 50% of India’s population ie., 814 million is expected to live in urban areas.

Given this scenario, the present infrastructure and amenities in cities and towns are not adequate to address the expanding urbanization process.

Several initiatives were launched by the government to promote urban infrastructure in the country. Major initiative is the twin effort of Smart Cities Mission and the AMRUT scheme.

**(1) The Smart Cities Mission**

The Smart Cities Mission is a major urban renewal program launched by the Government to develop and upgrade living conditions and infrastructure in selected 100 cities all over the country.

Objective of the programme is to modernize cities by providing core infrastructure and give a decent quality of life to its citizens, a clean and sustainable environment and application of ‘Smart’ Solutions. The programme was officially launched on 25th of June 2016 and in the first phase, 20 cities will get funding for converting them into smart cities. In the next two years, the remaining cities will also participate in the project. Ministry of Urban Development is the anchoring agency for the implementation of the project.

The main focus of the project is the *area based development* of cities by transforming existing areas through retrofitting and redevelopment. Another component of the smart cities project is the development of new areas or greenfield areas. Similarly, adoption of Smart Solutions with the use technology, information and data are expected to improve infrastructure and services under the project.

**Financing of smart cities mission**

Financing of the mission will be collaboratively done by the Centre, state and local bodies. Fund from the private sector will be invited and Public Private Partnerships will support the project financially.

The most vital contribution will be provided by the centre as it will provide Rs. 48,000 crores over five years i.e. on an average Rs. 100 crore per city per year. Matching the center’s contribution, an equal amount will be made by the State/ULBs. Altogether nearly one lakh crore rupees from government sources will be available for Smart Cities Project. For the implementation of the project each city should form a dedicated Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV).

**(2) Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) Project**

Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) along with smart cities were jointly planned and launched by the government to transform urban living conditions through infrastructure upgradation. AMRUT is aimed at transforming 500 cities and towns into efficient urban living spaces over a period of five years. Ministry of Urban Development has selected the five hundred cities with the help of state governments.

A project oriented development approach is adopted under the scheme in contrast to the area based approach of Smart Cities Mission. The Cabinet approved Rs 50,000 crore for this mission which is to be spent over a period five years. This is a centrally sponsored scheme with 80% budgetary support from the Centre.

**Mission of AMRUT is to**

- ensure that every household has access to a tap with assured supply of water and a sewerage connection;
- increase the amenity value of cities by developing greenery and well maintained open spaces (e.g. parks); and
- reduce pollution by switching to public transport or constructing facilities for non-motorized transport (e.g. walking and cycling).

**(3) Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) or Housing for All by 2022 Mission**

The ‘Housing for All by 2022’ under the scheme of “Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Housing for All (Urban)” launched by the central government aims to provide housing to all urban people by 2022. It provides central assistance to States and UTs for constructing houses to all eligible sections by concentrating on urban slums and economically weaker sections. Hence, slum rehabilitation and affordable housing to Economically Weaker Sections are the major features of the project.

**The programme has following components: –**

1.  a) Slum rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers with participation of private developers using land as a resource;
2.  b) Promotion of Affordable Housing for weaker section through credit linked subsidy;
3.  c) Affordable housing in partnership with Public & Private sectors and
4.  d) Subsidy for beneficiary-led individual house construction or enhancement.

**(4) Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY)**

The HRIDAY scheme is launched fro the holistic development of heritage cities. It amis to preserve and revitalize the unique character of heritage cities in India. for the first phase of the programme Rs , 500 crore is allocated with full funding by the central government. Twelve cities—including Ajmer, Amaravati, Amritsar etc are identified for the project.

**(5) Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission**

JNNURM was launched in 2005 as the flagship scheme for urban development. The programme had two components viz., Basic Services for Urban poor (BSUP) and Integrated Housing and Slum Development Programme (IHSDP). Civic amenities were improved under the programme including urban transportation. The programme aimed at integrated development of slums through projects for providing shelter, basic services and other related civic amenities.

**(6) Urban transportation**

Several initiatives were taken to enhance public transport system including the Bus Rapid Transit Systems (BRTS) approved for 11 cities under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM). The transportation system will be equipped with Intelligent Transport System (ITS) and Metro Rail Projects.

**(7) Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM)**

A major associated urban development programme is making India’s urban centres clean. For this, the SBM targets to achieve 100 per cent scientific management of municipal solid waste in 4041 statutory towns/ cities in the country by 2019.

Besides the above initiatives, several associated development programmes like industrial corridors, NHDP, Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, National Urban Livelihood Mission etc., aims to add infrastructure and other amenities to the urban areas.

### Infrastructural reforms taken in the above sectors

### Measures to further improve infrastructure in the country

    -   **Other recommendation**
        -   **Inject Private Investment**
            -   The completion of pending projects will take huge amounts of private investment.
            -   This can be achieved in two ways:
                -   firstly, reviving DBFOT or design, build, finance, operate and transfer mode of any project execution, and
                -   secondly, raising investment resources via aggressive asset monetisation
            -   **Overhaul the Credit Ecosystem**
                -   Due to rising NPAs and owing to Covid-19, banks have developed cold feet with regard to financing various projects due to high asset liability mismatches and related execution risks.
                -   Therefore, in such a scenario, the government needs to either come up with a bond guarantee or enhance credit funds for the projects so that the bond market is rejuvenated to fulfil the financing requirements of the sector.
            -   **Harness Latest Technologies**
                -   It is quite surprising how majority large-scale construction projects in India do not employ cutting-edge project management software and tools even now, which are allowing other countries to finish their projects at a much quicker pace.
                -   Technologies such as augmented reality (AR), UAV and drones, 3D printing, Internet of Things (IoT) and Building Information Modelling (BIM) come in handy when fast-tracking construction projects.
            -   **Streamline Priorities**
                -   It’s important that the government identifies the key programmes and ventures so that it can direct resources to only those, rather than spreading them all over multiple projects.
                -   For example, creating Ministry of Jal Shakti, under which the government has committed to supplying piped drinking water to every household by 2024, and which will take over all other programmes connected to the management of water resources.

​
This efficient approach will help redirect resources from multiple ministries to a singular, tangible, and achievable goal.

### Social Infrastructure

### Concept of social sector and social infrastructure

Social infrastructure includes the construction and maintenance of facilities that support social services. These can include healthcare (medical facilities and ancillary infrastructure), education (schools, universities and student accommodation), and housing.

**Examples of Social Infrastructure Assets**

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sector</strong></td><td><strong>Examples</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Health</td><td>Medical facilities<br>Ancillary infrastructure (e.g. offices, carparks, training facilities)</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Schools (primary and secondary)<br>Tertiary facilities<br>Residential student accommodation</td></tr><tr><td>Housing</td><td>State or Council housing<br>Defense force housing</td></tr><tr><td>Civic and Utilities</td><td>Community &amp; sports facilities<br>Local government facilities<br>Water and wastewater treatment</td></tr><tr><td>Transport</td><td>Bus stations<br>Park and rides<br>Availability-based roading (excluding demand-risk toll roads)</td></tr><tr><td>Corrections and Justice</td><td>Prisons<br>Courthouses</td></tr></tbody></table>

The Social Infrastructure in India includes the education system in India, health care, the management of the education and health services in India that form the basic social infrastructure definition. The India government looks after the social development in India by careful infrastructure planning and handling the social issues in close coordination

### Development of Education In India

**History after Independence**

In **First Five Year Plan** 7.9% of total plan outlay was allocated for education.

In **Second and Third Plan**, the allocations were 5.8% and 6.9% of the total plan outlay.

In **Ninth Plan** only 3.5% of the total outlay was allocated for education.

To streamline the education, the Govt. implemented the recommendations of **Kothari Commission under ‘National Policy on Education’ in 1968.** The main recommendations were

- universal primary education.
- Introduction of new pattern of education,
- three language formula,
- introduction of regional language in higher education,
- development of agricultural and industrial education and
- adult education.

To combat the changing socio-economic needs of the country, Govt. of India announced a new **National Policy on Education in 1986. Main features :-**

- Universalisation of primary education,
- vocationalisation of secondary education and
- specialisation of higher education were the main features of this policy.

National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) at National level and State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) at State level were established to maintain the standard of education.

University Grants Commission (UGC) was instituted to determine the standard of higher education

1.  **Expansion of General Education:**

During the period of planning there has been expansion of general education.

<table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>1950-51</strong></td><td><strong>2000-01</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Percentage Literacy</strong></td><td><strong>19.3%</strong></td><td><strong>65.4%</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Enrollment Ratio of Children (6-11 Year age group)</strong></td><td><strong>43%</strong></td><td><strong>100%</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Primary Schools</strong></td><td><strong>2.1 Lakh</strong></td><td><strong>6.4 Lakh</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Universities</strong></td><td><strong>27</strong></td><td><strong>254</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>

Primary education – been free and compulsory.

Midday meal has been started in schools since 1995 to check drop-out rate.

2.  **Development of Technical Education:**

Besides general education, technical education plays important role in human capital formation. The Govt. has established several Industrial Training Institutes, Polytechnics, Engineering colleges and Medical and Dental colleges, Management institutes etc.

**These are given below:**

(a) Indian Institute of Technology:

For education and research in engineering and technology of international standard, seven institutes have been established at Mumbai, Delhi, Kanpur, Chennai, Khargpur, Roorkee and Gauhati, Technical education is imparted here both for graduation and post-graduation and doctorate level.

(b) National Institute of Technology (NIT):

These institutes impart education in engineering and technology. These were called Regional College of Engineering (REC). These are 17 in number throughout the country. There are other institutes in the country to teach engineering and technical education.

(c) Indian Institute of Management:

These institutes impart education in business management and administration. These institutes are located at Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Kolkata, Lucknow, Indore and Kozhikode.

(d) Medical education:

There were only 28 medical colleges in the country in 1950-51. There were 165 medical and 40 dental colleges in the country in 1998-99.

(e) Agricultural education:

Agricultural Universities have been started in almost all States to improve production and productivity of agriculture. These universities impart education and research in agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry and veterinary sciences etc.

3.  **Women education:**

In India, literary among women was quite low. It was 52% according to 2001 census. While the literacy among men was 75.8%.

Women education was given top priority in National Policy on Education. Many State Governments have exempted the tuition fee of girl’s up to university level. Separate schools and colleges have been established to raise level of literacy among women.

4.  **Vocational education:**

National Policy of Education, 1986, aims at vocationalisation of secondary education. Central Govt. has been giving grants to State Governments to implement the programme since 1988. Agriculture, Pisciculture, diary, poultry, typing, electronics, mechanical and carpentry etc. had been included in higher secondary curriculum.

5.  **Growth of higher education:**

In 1951, there were 27 universities. Their number increased to 254 in 2001.

6.  **Non-formal education:**

This scheme was launched on an experimental basis from the Sixth plan and on regular basis from Seventh plan. The aim was to achieve universal elementary education to all children in the age group of 6-14 years. The scheme was meant for those children who cannot attend schools regularly and for full time due to poverty and pre-occupation with other works.

The Central Govt. is providing assistance to State Govt. and voluntary organisation to implement the scheme. Non-formal education centres have been set up in remote rural areas, hilly and tribal areas and in slums. These impart education to children of 6-14 age group.

7.  **Encouragement to Indian Language and Culture:**

After the adoption of National Policy of Education 1968, regional language became the medium of instruction in higher education. Syllabus on science and technology, dictionaries, books, and Question Papers are translated into regional languages. Indian history and culture have been included in school and college curriculum.

8.  **Adult education:**

Adult education refers to the education for the illiterate people belonging to the age group of 15-35 years.

The National Board of Adult Education was established in the First Five Year Plan. The village level workers were assigned the job of providing adult education. The progress remained not too good.

The National Adult Education Programme was started in 1978. The programme is considered as a part of primary education. National Literary Mission was also started in 1988 to eradicate adult illiteracy particularly in rural areas.

The Centre gives assistance to states, voluntary organisations and some selected universities to implement this programme. There were 2.7 lakh adult education centres working in the country in 1990-91. This programme helped to raise the literacy rate to 65.38% in 2001.

9.  **Improvement of Science education:**

Central Govt. started a scheme for the improvement of science education in schools in 1988. Financial assistance is given to provide science kits, up gradation of science laboratories, development of teaching material, and training of science and mathematics teachers. A Central Institute of Educational Technology (CIET) was set up in NCERT to purchase equipment for State Institutes of Educational Technology.

10. **Education for all:**

According to 93rd Amendment, education for all has been made compulsory. The elementary education is a fundamental right of all children in the age group of 6-14 years. It is also free. To fulfill this obligation Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) has been launched.

The above discussion makes it clear that a lot of development in education has been made in India after Independence. There is wide growth in general education and higher education. Efforts have been made to spread education among all sections and all regions of the country. Still our education system is ridden with problems.

**Schemes for Elementary Education**

1.  Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan
2.  Mid Day Meal
3.  Mahila Samakhya
4.  Strengthening for providing quality education in Madrassas ( SPQEM)

Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) is implemented as India’s main Programme for universalizing elementary education. Its overall goals include universal access and retention, bridging of gender and social category gaps in education and enhancement of learning levels of children.

**Mid-Day Meal Scheme**

Launched in 1995 as centrally sponsored scheme as the National Programme of Nutritional Support to Primary Education (NP-NSPE). Its objective was to enhance enrolment, retention and attendance and simultaneously improving nutritional levels among children,

**Schemes for Secondary Education**

Secondary Education is the most significant stage in the educational hierarchy as it prepares the students for higher education and the world of work. The policy at present is to make secondary education of good quality available, accessible and affordable to all young persons in the age group of 14-18. At present, the following schemes targeted at secondary stage (i.e. class IX to XII) are being implemented in the form of Centrally Sponsored Schemes:

1.  Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan
2.  Girls Hostel Scheme
3.  National Scheme of Incentives to Girls for Secondary Education
4.  Inclusive Education for Disabled at Secondary Stage
5.  Scheme of Vocational Education
6.  National Merit-cum-Means Scholarship Scheme
7.  Scheme for construction and running of Girls’ Hostel for students of secondary and higher secondary schools
8.  Scholarship schemes for Minority students
9.  National Scholarships

The National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) promotes educational development both in quantitative and qualitative terms and makes special efforts to remove disparities and equalize educational opportunities for all students.

NCERT acknowledges and appreciates educational brilliance in students through the National Talent Search Scheme. It also seeks to applaud artistic distinction through the Chacha Nehru Scholarships – for artistic and innovative excellence. The National Bal Bhawan has instituted a system of honouring talented children in different age groups in the year 1995 through the Bal Shree scheme.

**Schemes for Higher Education**

Higher Education is the shared responsibility of both the Centre and the States. The coordination and determination of standards in institutions is the constitutional obligation of the Central Government. The Central Government provides grants to UGC and establishes Central Universities in the country. Meritorious students, from families with or without necessary means, need an incentive or encouragement to keep on working hard in their studies and go to the next level of education in their academic career. This is where the scholarships and education loans play a crucial role.

**Following are some significant fellowship schemes/scholarships awarded by the various institutions:**

1.  Scheme of Apprenticeship Training
2.  National Scholarships
3.  Post-Doctoral Research Fellow (Scheme)
4.  Junior Research Fellowships for biomedical sciences
5.  All India Council for Technical Education Scholarships
6.  Department of Science and Technology grants and fellowships
7.  DST’s Scholarship Scheme for Women Scientists and Technologists
8.  Biotechnology fellowships for doctoral and postdoctoral studies by DBT
9.  Scholarships /Awards at Undergraduate & Postgraduate level in various science courses at the University of Delhi
10. Fellowships/Scholarships/Awards by the Jawaharlal Nehru University
11. Sports Authority of India promotional schemes
12. Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities – Schemes/Programmes
13. Scholarship Schemes for ST Students by Ministry of Tribal Affairs
14. Post-matric Scholarships for SC /ST students
15. Scholarships for Minority Students

**Important Issues in Indian Education System**

**1\. Lack of infrastructure**  
Approximately 95.2 per cent of schools are not yet compliant with the complete set of RTE infrastructure indicators according to survey conducted in 2010.They lacks drinking water facilities, a functional common toilet, and do not have separate toilets for girls.  
Number of boards causes non uniformity of curriculum throughout India so maintenance of quality standard is quite difficult.

**2\. Poor global ranking of institutes**  
Only 4 universities are featured in first 400 .This is largely because of high faculty-student ratio and lack of research capacity

**3\. System of education**  
Education is information based rather than knowledge based. The whole focus is on cramming information rather than understanding it and analyzing it.

**4\. Gap between education provided and industry required education**  
Industry faces a problem to find suitable employee as education provided is not suitable for directly working in industry so before that a company is required to spend large amount on providing training for employee.

**5\. Gender issues**  
Traditional Indian society suffers from many kind of discrimination so there are many hurdles in education of unprivileged sections of society like women, SC, ST and minority

**6\. Costly higher education**  
Very minimal amount of subsidy is provided for higher education so if student seeks to get chances of higher education still he misses out because of lack of economical resources

**7\. Inadequate government Funding**  
The demand for financial resources far exceeds the supply. Very small amount is available for innovative programs and ideas.

**Health care infrastructure – Challenges**

**Fund Allocation & Inadequate Infra**

The gap in fund management by the administrations should be understood and be balanced. Not enough funds are allocated for public healthcare in India and the inequality in urban and rural facilities is well known. Due to the lack of modern quality healthcare in the public sector, generally, people prefer private healthcare which is not affordable for most of the rural population due to lower-income and lack of basic insurance policy. Private healthcare in India is a premium and expensive affair for a large section of society. Notably expensive medical device is procured but basic infra is missing in public healthcare system.

**Lack of infrastructure**

India has been struggling with deficient infrastructure in the form of lack of well-equipped medical institutes for quite a while now. To add to it, the rate of building such medical teaching or training facilities remains less as compared to the need of the hour.

**Optimal Insurance based service a Challenge**

Insurance as a concept and its usefulness is still not understood in India due to which the insurance market in the country remains largely under-penetrated. Awareness campaigns and the government’s schemes such as Ayushman Bharat, Employment State Insurance, etc. have immensely helped in bringing insurance inclusiveness and enabling a large population in India to avail financial security cover on healthcare costs. However, with a large number of centre and state-specific insurance schemes comes the healthcare delivery and service challenges for the public sector healthcare system.

**Shortage of efficient and trained manpower**

One of the most pressing problems in India remains a severe shortage of trained manpower in the medical stream, this includes doctors, nurses, paramedics and primary healthcare workers. The situation remains worrisome in rural areas, where almost 66 per cent of India’s population resides.

The doctor-to-patient ratio remains abysmally low, which is merely 0.7 doctors per 1,000 people.

This is compared to the World Health Organisation (WHO) average of 2.5 doctors per 1,000 people. Improving this situation continues to remain a long-term process.

**Unmanageable patient-load**

Even prior to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, healthcare facilities had been feeling the strain due to unmanageable patient-load. Moreover, serving a population of 1.4 billion remains a Herculean task in itself when it comes to suitably managing healthcare facilities.

There is a need to adopt technology wherever possible to streamline the operational and clinical processes for healthcare facilities in order to manage efficient patient flow. In addition, there is the challenge to think beyond the obvious and promote virtual care protocols, and telehealth services, which can be leveraged to reduce the patient-load burden to a large extent.

**Public health policy and proactive healthcare**

The latest National Health Policy (NHP) 2017 highlights the ‘Health for All’ approach to provide assured healthcare for all at an affordable cost. However, there is scope to do much more under the NHP 2017. Ideally, the public health policy needs to be focussed towards proactive healthcare, not reactive healthcare.

Besides, in the case of the government’s Ayushman Bharat scheme, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), the universal health insurance scheme, has received considerable attention and resources than the health and wellness centres (HWCs) component. This asymmetry needs to be suitably addressed for the growth of healthcare in the future.

**High out-of-pocket expenditure remains a stress factor**

While public hospitals offer free health services, these facilities are understaffed, poorly equipped, and located mainly in urban areas. It is a known fact that accessible and affordable healthcare in the public sector can considerably reduce the rise in dependence on private institutions. However, governmental facilities leave no alternatives but to access private institutions and incurring high out-of-pocket expenses in healthcare. Most health services are, therefore, provided by private facilities, and 65 per cent of medical expenses in India are paid out of pocket by patients.

A possible solution to address the issue could be to increase the adoption of health insurance. In this regard, the government and private institutions both need to work together. Adoption of digital insurance processing solutions integrated with the healthcare ecosystem for faster turnaround time for insurance processes will also motivate adoption of health insurance.

**Less emphasis on Preventive Care**

Like insurance, very little to no focus is given to preventive care in India. Preventive care can actually solve a lot of problems for the patient in terms of misery or financial losses. Lack of awareness is a key reason for the current situation. Proper preventive care can help save huge costs for the patient and reduce the burden on the limited healthcare infra system in the country.

In current times of COVID19, one can see a lot of people breaking lockdown rules and not even following the basics of masks and gloves, despite government running campaigns on preventive care for the virus. The general health advisory may not solve the root cause of the illness and may invariably add up to an escalated cost owing to a prolonged treatment process. The need of the hour is to increase the number of specialised medical experts in the country.

**Delay in Diagnosis of Illnesses**

As goes an old saying, A stitch in time saves nine, post preventive care, the next step is the diagnosis, if done in time can not only help save cost but also lives in some cases. We often hear of cases being diagnosed only at an advanced stage when very little can be done to save the life. The importance of diagnosis is mostly doubted in India.

**No Support for Medical Research**

Indian players so far continue to be the followers of global trends and contract manufacturers for MNCs at best, while not much impetus is given to R&D, and cutting-edge technology-led new initiatives. Even when it comes to updating the knowledge of new discoveries in the medical field we are far behind. The medical professionals and pharmaceutical companies should keep themselves updated with knowledge of the latest development in the field of the medical sector that will help them to cater the right services to patients with minimum risk. Having state of the art technology requires huge cost. On the other hand, adopting ‘Made in India’ medical devices which are more reliable and economical will help the administrator to balance the fund profile and save a huge amount of the capital which can be used for providing basic facilities to the patients.

**Cost & Transparency**

The most important aspect and perhaps which touches most of us is that the cost and transparency of treatment. In an ideal situation it should be like a menu card in a restaurant; where ingredients and rates of services are mentioned in advance, so the patient does not get surprised on receipt of bills. Besides patients can decide whether to take those services or not; looking at his/her budget. Besides these, patients can also decide whether to opt for those services or not; keeping their budget in mind.

Serving the Nation by providing services empathetically, without any vested interest can give great joy which is a reward in itself for the medical professional and pharmaceutical companies. What primarily ails the healthcare system is that there has been a general lack of focus on the vertical from the government. For years now, knee-jerk reaction work is being witnessed towards the improvement of quality of service.

**National Health Policy 2017**

**Previous Policies**

- - The National Health Policy of 1983 and
  - The National Health Policy of 2002

They have served well in guiding the approach for the health sector in the Five-Year Plans. The current context has however changed in four major ways.

- The health priorities are changing. Although maternal and child mortality have rapidly declined, there is growing burden on account of non-communicable diseases and some infectious diseases.
- The emergence of a robust health care industry estimated to be growing at double digit.
- The growing incidences of catastrophic expenditure due to health care costs, which are presently estimated to be one of the major contributors to poverty.
- A rising economic growth enables enhanced fiscal capacity. Therefore, a new health policy responsive to these contextual changes is required.

The National Health Policy, 2017 (NHP, 2017) seeks to reach everyone in a comprehensive integrated way to move towards wellness.  It aims at achieving universal health coverage and delivering quality health care services to all at affordable cost.

**Policy thrust**

1.  **Ensuring Adequate Investment** – The policy proposes a potentially achievable target of raising public health expenditure to 2.5% of the GDP in a time bound manner.
2.  **Preventive and Promotive Health** – The policy identifies coordinated action on seven priority areas for improving the environment for health:
    - The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
    - Balanced, healthy diets and regular exercises.
    - Addressing tobacco, alcohol and substance abuse
    - Yatri Suraksha – preventing deaths due to rail an d road traffic accidents
    - Nirbhaya Nari – action against gender violence
    - Reduced stress and improved safety in the work place
    - Reducing indoor and outdoor air pollution
3.  **Organization of Public Health Care Delivery** – The policy proposes seven key policy shifts in organizing health care services.

It has several challenges such as lack of infrastructure and amalgamation of various streams of the healthcare sector, which will have to be addressed if it has to be a success story.

- First, challenges of inadequate facilities, infrastructure, coverage, access and quality continue to plague the health system. Over 95% of facilities function with less than five workers, and only 195 hospitals in the entire nation operate with quality certifications. Essential diagnostics, such as mammograms have scant coverage of only 1%
- While one would expect private sector care to have higher quality, there is increasing evidence suggesting poor quality. Problems with the public and private health setup are largely the same—gulf of difference between the reported and actual diagnostic and treatment facilities, the tendency of over-prescribing and subjecting patients to unnecessary interventions, lack of efficient monitoring mechanisms, and poor implementation of regulatory controls
- limited use of the health management information system as a proactive management tool in government health programmes. There is also inadequate linkage between research institutions and the implementation wing. The HIV/AIDS programme seems to be losing steam due to shortage of resources and dwindling political commitment,
- An area of major concern is environmental degradation, with the pollution levels in most major cities reaching alarming proportions, even as India wakes up to a major health threat. “Almost half of our urban population does not have basic civic amenities. In the name of industrialization and development of our backward areas, we are polluting the limited sources of safe drinking water of local communities. The indiscriminate use of pesticides is a cause for serious long-term worry. Public places and even the holiest rivers of this country are fast turning into garbage dumps,
