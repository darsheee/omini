# Central Govt- <mark>Expenditure</mark>

:::details Revenue expenditure of Union/Central government

:::details  Revenue  Deficit

- The revenue deficit refers to the excess of government’s revenue expenditure over revenue receipts.
- Revenue deficit = (**Revenue expenditure – Revenue receipts**)
- If the balance of revenue receipts and revenue expenditures turns out to be negative it is known as revenue deficit.
- This shows that the government’s <mark>Revenue Budget is running in losses</mark> and the government is earning less revenue and spending more revenues — incurring a deficit.
- The term 'revenue deficit' (RD) is traditionally defined as the difference between revenue receipts and revenue expenditures.
- Revenue expenditures encompass all grants given by the Union Government to state governments and Union Territories (UTs), some of which are used to create assets. These assets are not owned by the Government of India but by the respective state governments and UTs.
- In 2012, the Finance Ministry argued that such revenue expenditures contribute to economic growth and should not be considered unproductive like other items in the revenue expenditures.
- Based on this reasoning, a new methodology called "Effective Revenue Deficit" was introduced. This measures the revenue deficit excluding those revenue expenditures of the Government of India that were used to create capital assets (GoCA).
- GoCA includes grants from the Government of India to states and UTs for implementing centrally sponsored programmes such as Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme, Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, etc.
- These expenses, although recorded as Revenue Expenditures by the Government of India, are associated with asset creation and cannot be considered entirely unproductive. This led to the creation of a new terminology.

:::details Fiscal Deficit
- Fiscal deficit occurs when the balance of the government’s total receipts (i.e., revenue + capital receipts) and total expenditures (i.e., revenue + capital expenditures) is negative, indicating that the government is spending beyond its income.
- The fiscal deficit of the governments (Centre and States) has been continuously increasing due to various socio-economic reasons.
- Efforts to contain the fiscal deficit have been made since the enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act in 2003.

- The primary deficit is the fiscal deficit excluding the interest liabilities for a year. It represents the fiscal deficit for the year in which the economy did not have to fulfil any interest payments on the different loans and liabilities.

- Deficit financing is the process by which a government finances a deficit budget. The government anticipates that its total expenditures will exceed its total receipts and adopts financial policies to sustain the proposed deficits.

- External aids, external borrowings, internal borrowings, and printing currency are the means of deficit financing in India.
- External aids are the most preferred means to fulfil a government’s deficit requirements, especially if they come with soft interest or without interest.
- External borrowings are the next best way to manage fiscal deficit, provided the loans are comparatively cheaper and long-term.
- Internal borrowings are the third preferred route of fiscal deficit management, but excessive reliance on it can hamper the investment prospects of the public and the corporate sector.
- Printing currency is the last resort for the government in managing its deficit, but it can lead to inflation and other damaging effects on the economy.
:::

:::details FRBM Act

- The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act was passed in 2003, which puts constitutional obligation on the government to commit to fiscal responsibility.
- The Act mandates the government to fix annual targets to cut revenue and fiscal deficits, not to borrow from the RBI except by the WMA, bring in greater transparency in fiscal operations, and lay statements regarding fiscal policy strategy in the House and Quarterly Review of trends of receipts and expenditures of the government.
- A mechanism to include state governments under the umbrella of fiscal responsibility was advised by the 12th Finance Commission, which allows the state governments to go for market borrowing for their need of plan development provided they pass their fiscal responsibility acts (FRAs) and commit to the fiscal responsibility regarding cutting their revenue and fiscal deficits.
:::

:::details Fiscal Consolidation
- Fiscal Consolidation refers to limiting Central & State government expenditure.
- A number of steps have been taken by the government at the Centre towards fiscal consolidation, including cutting down expenditure, increasing revenue receipts, committing to a borrowing programme, and taking on fiscal responsibility.
