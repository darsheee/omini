# Introduction

[[toc]]

- Inclusive means economic growth that creates employment opportunities and helps in reducing poverty.
- It means having access to essential services in health and education by the poor. It includes providing equality of opportunity, empowering people through education and skill development.
- It also encompasses a growth process that is environment friendly growth, aims for good governance and helps in creation of a gender sensitive society.
- As per OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), inclusive growth is economic growth that is distributed fairly across society and creates opportunities for all.

### Elements of Inclusive Growth

**Skill Development**

- Harnessing the demographic dividend will depend upon the employability of the working age population, their health, education, vocational training and skills. Skill development plays a key role here.
- India is facing a dual challenge in skill development:
  - First, there is a paucity of highly trained workforce
  - Second, there is non-employment of conventionally trained youths
- According to the Economic Survey 2017, over 30% of youth in India are NEET (Not in education, employment or training).
- Similarly, UNICEF 2019 reports stats that at least 47% of Indian youth are not on track to have the education and skills necessary for employment in 2030.

**Financial Inclusion**

- Financial Inclusion is the process of ensuring access to financial services to vulnerable groups at affordable costs.
- Financial inclusion is necessary for inclusive growth as it leads to the culture of saving, which initiates a virtuous cycle of economic development.

**Technological Advancement**

- The world is moving towards an era of [**Industrial Revolution 4.0.**] These technological advancements have capabilities to both decrease or increase the inequality depending on the way these are being used.
- Several initiatives have been taken by the government, eg. Digital India Mission, so that a digitally literate population can leverage technology for endless possibilities.
- Technology can help to combat other challenges too, eg:
  - **Agriculture-** Modern technology can help in making an agro-value chain from farmer to consumer more efficient and competitive.
  - **Manufacturing-** Technology can resolve the problems of finance, procuring raw materials, land, and linkages with the user market. GST was made possible only with the help of sound technology.
  - **Education-** Innovative digital technologies can create new forms of adaptive and peer learning, increasing access to trainers and mentors, providing useful data in real-time.
  - **Health-** Technologies could transform the delivery of public health services - extend care through remote health services
  - **Governance-** Technology can cut down delays, corruption, and inefficiency in the delivery of a public service

**Economic Growth**

- India is among the fastest-growing major economies in the world. However, currently Indian economy is facing slowdown due to both cyclic and structural challenges.
- However, the target of becoming a $ 5 trillion economy by 2024-25 can allow India to reduce inequality, increase social expenditure and provide employment to all.

**Social Development**

- It means the empowerment of all marginalised sections of the population like SC/ST/OBC/Minorities, women and transgenders.
- Empowerment can be done by improving institutions of the social structure i.e. hospitals especially primary care in the rural areas, schools, universities, etc.
- Investment in social structures will not only boost growth (by fiscal stimulus) but will also create a healthy and capable generation to handle future work.

### Challenges in Achieving Inclusive Growth

**Poverty**

- As per the **Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 2018,** India lifted 271 million people between 2005-06 and 2015-16, with the poorest regions, groups, and children, reducing poverty fastest. India demonstrates the clearest pro-poor pattern at the sub-national level.
- Still, despite the massive gains, 373 million Indians continue to experience acute deprivations. Additionally, 8.8% of the population lives in severe multidimensional poverty and 19.3% of the population are vulnerable to multidimensional poverty.

**Unemployment**

- As per the [**Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) of NSSO,**] the unemployment rate among the urban workforce was 7.8%, while the unemployment rate for the rural workforce was 5.3% totaling the total unemployment rate at 6.1%.
- The quality and quantity of employment in India are low due to illiteracy and due to over-dependence on agriculture.
- The quality of employment is a problem as more than 80% of people work in the informal sector without any social security.
- Low job growth is due to the following factors:
  - Low investment
  - Low capital utilization in industry
  - Low agriculture growth

**Agriculture Backwardness**

- Around 44% of people in India have agriculture-related employment but its contribution to the Indian GDP is only 16.5% which lead to widespread poverty
- Issues in agriculture are as follows:
  - Declining per capita land availability
  - A slow reduction in the share of employment
  - Low labour productivity
  - Decline in agriculture yield due to climate change, land degradation and unavailability of water
  - Disparities in growth across regions and crops

**Issues with Social Development**

- Social development is one of the key concerns for inclusive growth. But it is facing some problems such as:
  - Significant regional, social and gender disparities
  - Low level and slow growth in public expenditure particularly in health and education
  - The poor quality delivery system
  - Social indicators are much lower for OBC, SC, ST, and Muslims
  - Malnutrition among the children - [**India ranks 102nd in Global Hunger Index**]

**Regional Disparities**

- Regional disparities are a major concern for India. Factors like the caste system, gap between rich and poor etc. contribute to the regional disparities which create a system where some specific groups hold more privileges over others.
- Some of the regional disparities problems are as follow:
  - In terms of literacy rate, Kerala is the most literate state with 93.1% literacy, on the other hand, literacy rate of Bihar is only 63.82%
  - In terms of per capita income, Goa's per capita income is Rs 4,67,998 in 2018 while per capita income of Bihar is just one-tenth of that ie Rs 43,822

### Measuring Inclusive Growth

**Inclusive Development Index (IDI)**

- In the Inclusive Development Index (IDI) compiled by the World Economic Forum (WEF), India ranked 62nd out of 74 emerging countries and was among the least inclusive countries in Group of 20 (G-20) countries.
- The IDI is based on the idea that most people base their country’s growth not on GDP but by their own standard of living.
- It gives a measure of inequality based on three parameters: :
  - Growth and development
  - Inclusion
  - Inter-generational equity and sustainability.
- India also did not make it to the top 10 most inclusive emerging and developing economies, where its neighbours Nepal, China and Sri Lanka made a mark.
- India performed its best in terms of “intergenerational equity and sustainability”, ranking 44th, for which credit can be attributed to its demographic dividend.

**Social Progress Index (SPI)**

- It is an aggregate index of social and environmental indicators which includes the following:
  - Basic human need
  - Foundation of well being
  - Opportunity
- Limitation of other indices:
  - GDP: It does not include non-market activities.
    - Excludes factors like environment, equality, etc
  - Gini Coefficient:
    - Only income inequalities are included and other inequalities like social inequality, equality of opportunities, etc are ignored.
  - Gross Happiness Index:
    - Ignores gender neutrality, education, etc
  - HDI:
    - The unequal distribution of wealth is ignored.
- Benefits of SPI:
  - SPI measures the outcomes of the government measures rather than money spent. It also takes account of efficiency by which money spent by the government has been used.
  - It is more comprehensive.

**Global Slavery Index**

- It is released by the Walk Free Foundation of Australia.
- Modern Slavery means a situation where one person has taken away another person's freedom, to control their body so that they can be exploited.
- Factors responsible for modern slavery:
  - Absence of rights
  - Lack of physical safety
  - Access to necessities such as health care, education, food, etc
  - Pattern of migration
- Government actions to reduce modern slavery:
  - India has worked in the right direction by criminalizing trafficking, slavery, forced labor, child prostitution, and child marriage.

### Measures Taken India to Achieve Inclusive Growth

- Several schemes are being implemented by the government for inclusive growth which includes the following:
  - Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act Scheme (MGNREGA)
  - Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP)
  - Mudra Bank scheme
  - Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY)
  - Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM)
  - Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA)
  - National Rural Health Mission (NRHM)
  - Bharat Nirman
  - Swachh Bharat Mission
  - Mission Ayushman
  - Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana
- Government is working with NGOs and International groupings in policy making eg:
  - DISHA Project is being implemented in partnership with UNDP for creating employment and entrepreneurship opportunities for women in India.
- NITI Aayog's Strategy for New India @75 has the following objectives for the inclusive growth:
  - To have a rapid growth, which reaches 9-10% by 2022-23, which is inclusive, clean, sustained and formalized.
  - To Leverage technology for inclusive, sustainable and participatory development by 2022-23.
  - To have an inclusive development in the cities to ensure that urban poor and slum dwellers including recent migrants can avail city services.
  - To make schools more inclusive by addressing the barriers related to the physical environment (e.g. accessible toilets), admission procedures as well as curriculum design.
  - To make higher education more inclusive for the most vulnerable groups.
  - To provide quality ambulatory services for an inclusive package of diagnostic, curative, rehabilitative and palliative care, close to the people.
  - To prepare an inclusive policy framework with citizens at the center

**Note:**

- World Economic Forum has suggested 3 practical ways by which countries can boost social inclusion as well as economic growth:
  - First, **countries should increase public and private investment in their citizens’ capabilities,** which is the most important way they can durably lift their rate of productivity growth.
  - Second, governments, together with employers’ and workers’ organizations, **should upgrade national rules and institutions relating to work.** These influence the quantity and distribution of job opportunities and compensation, and thus the level of purchasing power and aggregate demand within the economy.
  - Third, **countries should increase public and private investment in labor-intensive economic sectors** that generate wider benefits for society. These include sustainable water, energy, digital, and transport infrastructure, care sectors, the rural economy, and education and training.

### Conclusion

- Indian government along with the state governments and local governments should continue to focus on eradicating poverty and achieving sustainable development in order to improve the lives of India's people.
- Through innovative partnerships with an international organization, civil societies, and private companies, inclusive and equitable growth can be targeted.
- Inclusive growth will help in the empowerment of vulnerable and marginalized populations, improve livelihoods, and augment skill-building for women.

\*\*Different Components of Inclusive Growth – 11th 5year Access to essential services

- Employment Generation
- Women empowerment
- Good governance
- Skill building
- Equality of opportunity
- Poverty Reduction

**Inclusive Growth and 12th Five Year - The ment begins with anticipating **three economic scenarios** at the end of the 12th se three scenarios are “**Strong inclusive growth**”, “**Insufficient action**” and “**Policy Logjam\*\*”.

- The first one viz. **Strong inclusive growth** is the most optimistic one but needs effective implementation and a robust government.

**The ment discusses the following aspects of inclusiveness:**

- **Inclusiveness as Poverty Reduction**: So that adequate flow of benefits to the poor and the most marginalised.
- **Inclusiveness as Group Equality**: The poor are certainly one target group, but inclusiveness must also embrace the concern of other groups such as the Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), Other Backward Classes (OBCs), Minorities, women, the differently abled and other marginalised groups.
- **Inclusiveness as Regional Balance**: This aspect of inclusiveness relates to whether all States, and indeed all regions, are seen to benefit from the growth process. Improvement in infrastructure must therefore be an important component of any regionally inclusive development strategy.
- **Inclusiveness as Reducing Inequality**: There is a need to keep inequality into tolerable limits.
- **Inclusiveness as Empowerment**: The ment says that inclusiveness is not just about ensuring a broad-based flow of benefits or economic opportunities; it is also about empowerment and participation.
- **Inclusiveness through Employment Programmes:** The document stresses on the quality of assets created, which will determine whether MGNREGA can go beyond the safety net to become a springboard for entrepreneurship, even at the lowest income levels.

**NITI Aayog’s Strategy for inclusive growth:**

**New India @75** **vision** has the following objectives for the inclusive growth:

1.  To have a rapid growth, which **reaches 9-10%** by 2022-23, which is inclusive, clean, sustained and formalized.
2.  To Leverage technology for inclusive, sustainable and participatory development by 2022-23.
3.  To have an inclusive development in the cities to ensure that urban poor and slum dwellers including recent migrants can avail city services.
4.  To make schools more inclusive by addressing the barriers related to the physical environment (e.g. accessible toilets), admission procedures as well as curriculum design.
5.  To make higher education more inclusive for the most vulnerable groups.
6.  To provide quality ambulatory services for an inclusive package of diagnostic, curative, rehabilitative and palliative care, close to the people.
7.  To prepare an inclusive policy framework with citizens at the centre.

**Policy Approaches for Inclusive Growth:**

As far as the policy framework is concerned, the govt. lacks a suitable policy vis-a-vis Inclusive Growth. Nonetheless, the govt. has experimented with various models of Inclusive Growth.

According to World Bank’s review of India’s Development Policy, Inclusive Growth policy implementation is facing a dilemma of improving the delivery of core public services, and maintaining rapid growth while spreading the benefits of this growth more widely.

The strategy for the inclusive growth per needs to be an integrating strategy comprising state, market, civil societies and common man.

Since independence, the govt. has practiced various types of policy measures, a few are discussed ahead:

**Growth oriented policy:**

- - India’s economic started with growth oriented policy. First 1-56) was started with an objective of rapid and balanced growth.
  - The second 6-61) also put a thrust on rapid growth of industrialization. More recent, twelfth five year 7-12) has blended economic growth with inclusion with an objective of Faster,
  - Sustainable and More Inclusive Growth. Arvind Virmani, ex-chief economic advisor to govt. of India has divided the policy approaches for economic growth in following phases:
    - Phase 1: 1950-1 to 1979-80 (two sub-phases: 1950 50-65 to 1966-79)
    - Phase 2: 1980-81 to 1993-94 (change in policy regime, reform initiation and structural adjustment in the economic policy.)
    - Phase 3: 1994-5 to onwards (Statistical significant growth break (1994-5) and rising growth trend)
  - The rate of economic growth has increased with time, particularly in phase 3, which is a result of radical reforms during 1990s.
  - However, it has failed to emphasize inclusive growth by creating more jobs for low and semi-skilled workers. Growth is not equally shared and in many parts of the country, people still remain poor and disadvantaged in significant proportion.

**Direct intervention:**

- - The direct intervention is facilitating the Inclusive Growth through legislation, regulation, credit facilitation and providing livelihood security are the forms of direct intervention by the govt.
  - Now, the orientation of administrative machinery is transformed from regulator to facilitator. Govt. direct intervention from the perspective of Inclusive Growth now be seen in making available the requisite social investment, establishing independent regulatory institutional mechanism, drafting incentive based policy and encouraging entrepreneurial innovation.
  - Safety nets or anti-poverty measures are the some other ways of direct intervention of the govt. towards Inclusive Growth.

**Capacity Building:**

- - Skill development is basically capacity development. However, capacity development is not only limited to skill building or entrepreneurial innovation.
  - Capacity development through training of rural development functionaries is also a mean of capacity building. Now, creating job and market demand is not the only criteria of capacity development.
  - Increasing efficiency, effectiveness, accountability and transparency are also considered the areas under capacity building initiatives of the govt. For example, if the objective of Department of Rural Development is enhancing the livelihood security of households in rural areas though MNREGA then capacity building for enhancing effectiveness of Gram Sabha is one of the modalities to achieve the objective.

**Welfare schemes:**

- - Food subsidies, public distribution of essential commodities, nutrition programs, financial support though micro finance are examples of the ways in which welfare schemes are implemented.
  - For different types of beneficiaries (women, Children, BPL etc.) central and state govt. have come with the customized welfare schemes. The approach in welfare schemes is to benefit the beneficiaries through optimal allocation of resources and access to essential services.
  - Integrated Child Development Scheme is a type of welfare scheme with children and women as beneficiaries. It is India’s flagship scheme for the nutritional and developmental needs of children.

**Public Participation:**

- - Without public participation at different level of governance, Inclusive Growth remains a distant dream. Govt. is encouraging the public participation in multifarious ways towards which the common man must show an affirmative and pro-active response.
  - SHGs promotion is a typical example of public participation for Inclusive Growth. Govt. can provide the supporting platform for citizen centric services, the responsibility to deliver still is of the common man.
  - SHGs support and promotion programs have yielded good results in South Indian states, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh particularly. Kerala govt. supported Kudumbasree programme have been successful in women empowerment and reducing poverty. Similar initiative of Andhra Pradesh namely ‘Indira Kranti Pathakam’ is showing a good progress in social mobilization, gender empowerment and rural poverty reduction.
  - Lastly, policy intervention takes place both at micro and macro level. Improving fiscal discipline, trade liberalization, promoting Foreign Direct Investment, privatization, deregulation, tax reforms, labour laws, social safety nets, public expenditure etc. are important for macro policy measures while at the micro level, reducing inequality in income, improving public/social infrastructure, healthcare, education, access to essential services, accountability and transparency, women empowerment, role of civil society organizations, etc are instrument of micro policy which needs to be re-worked.

<!-- As per OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), inclusive growth is economic growth that is distributed fairly across society and creates opportunities for all.
“Inclusive Growth refers both to the pace and pattern of growth, which are interlinked and must be addressed together.”- World Bank
UNDP has described inclusive growth as “the process and the outcome where all groups of people have participated in growth and have benefited equitably from it”.
Inclusive growth entails comprehensive growth, shared growth, and pro-poor growth.
It lessens the fast growth rate of poverty in a country and upsurges the participation of people into the development of the country.
Inclusive growth infers an impartial allocation of resources with benefits incurred to every section of the society. But the allocation of resources must be focused on the intended short and long term benefits of the society such as availability of consumer goods, people access, employment, standard of living etc.


Salient Features of Inclusive Growth
Address the constraints of the excluded and marginalised.
Participation from all sections of society
Reduction in disparities among per capita incomes between:
Different sectors of economy
Different Sections of society
Rural And Urban Areas
Different genders
Non – discriminatory
Higher potential of poverty reduction
Ensure access of people to basic infrastructure and basic services/capabilities such as basic health and education. This access should include not only the quantity, but also quality of these basic services.
Include poor, lagging socio – economic groups and lagging regions as well as they are partners in this growth.


Elements of Inclusive growth
Inclusive growth is a multi-dimensional concept that facilitates inclusion from a variety of fronts that include:

Skill Development: Harnessing the demographic dividend will depend upon the employability of the working age population, their health, education, vocational training and skills. Skill development plays a key role here. India is facing a dual challenge in skill development:
There is a paucity of highly trained workforce
There is non-employment of conventionally trained youths
According to the Economic Survey 2017, over 30% of youth in India are NEET (Not in education, employment or training).
Financial Inclusion: Financial Inclusion is the process of ensuring access to financial services to vulnerable groups at affordable costs.
Financial inclusion is necessary for inclusive growth as it leads to the culture of saving, which initiates a virtuous cycle of economic development.
Technological Advancement: The world is moving towards an era of Industrial Revolution 4.0. These technological advancements have capabilities to either decrease or increase the inequality depending on the way these are being used. Several initiatives have been taken by the government, e.g. Digital India Mission, so that a digitally literate population can leverage technology for endless possibilities. Technology can help to combat other challenges too.
Economic Growth: India is among the fastest-growing major economies in the world. However, currently Indian economy is facing slowdown due to both cyclic and structural challenges. However, the target of becoming a $ 5 trillion economy by 2024-25 can allow India to reduce inequality, increase social expenditure and provide employment to all.
Social Development: It means the empowerment of all marginalised sections of the population like SC/ST/OBC/Minorities, women and transgender. Empowerment can be done by improving institutions of the social structure i.e. hospitals especially primary care in the rural areas, schools, universities, etc. Investment in social structures will not only boost growth (by fiscal stimulus) but will also create a healthy and capable generation to handle future work.

Need for Inclusion
For India, it is a tough task to accomplish inclusive growth. In a democratic country India, majority of population living in rural India and to bringing them into the mainstream is main concern. The challenge for Indian government is to take the levels of growth to all section of the society and to all parts of the country.
The best way to realise inclusive growth is through developing people’s talents. It is said by government authorities that a multidimensional approach towards education and skills development is essential to achieve growth. The challenge of skills shortage can be addressed through public private partnership. Since independence, noteworthy improvement in India’s economic and social development made the nation to grow strongly in the 21st century.
India is the 7th major country by area and 2nd by population. Yet, India is far away from development while our neighbour China is advancing at a faster rate to become the largest economy of the world.
Rapid and sustained poverty reduction requires inclusive growth that permits people to contribute to and benefit from economic growth. Poverty in India is at 22% according to the Tendulkar committee report.
Rapid growth is necessary to reduce poverty but for this growth to be sustainable in the long run, it should be broad-based across sectors, and inclusive of the large part of the country’s labour force. This ex of inclusive growth implies a direct link between the macro and micro determinants of growth.
The micro dimension denotes the importance of structural transformation for economic diversification and competition, including creative destruction of jobs and firms.
Inclusive growth is defined by many academicians as the pace and pattern of growth, which are considered interlinked, and therefore in need to be addressed together.
This inferred that inclusive growth should include all sections as recipients as well as partners in growth and that inclusion of the excluded should be embodied in the growth process.
Low agriculture growth, low-quality employment growth, low human development, rural-urban divides, gender and social inequalities, and regional disparities etc. are the problems for the nation.
Protests like the recent ones of Jats in Haryana, Patels in Gujarat will only rise if the issues of agriculture productivity, employment growth are not taken care of.
Labour productivity is very low due to in-formalisation and poor skill development.
Access to education and health is not the same for all sections of the population. Females are treated to be subordinate to males and are dependent on their families in all spheres. Inclusive growth is hence the key to women empowerment.
Regional inequalities are the cause for the rise in distress migration, either intra-state or inter-state. Distress migration further creates problems of housing, accommodation, safety, hygiene, and sanitation.
Financial Inclusion is the key to transforming the informal economy into the formal economy.
Corruption is still rampant in the country and prevents inclusive growth.
Political leadership plays a vital role in growth and development of the country. But implementation of many schemes is poor due to lack of political will.
The importance of inclusive growth is indisputable for sustainable growth.
Global warming and climate change affect poor more than the rich. Displaced population further increases distress migration and stress on state’s resources.
MDG report for India (2015) suggests that out of 18 indicators, India is on-track only in four indicators. In the rest of the indicators, India is identified as either off-track or moderately on-track. Achieving Sustainable Development Goals is not possible without concentrating on inclusive growth.
The inclusive growth approach takes huge perspective as the focus is on productive employment instead of direct income redistribution, as a means of increasing incomes for excluded groups.
In the short run, governments could use income distribution schemes to weaken negative impacts on the poor of strategies intended to jump start growth, but transfer schemes cannot be an answer in the long run and can be challenging also in the short run.
In poor countries such schemes can impose major burdens on already stretched budgets, and it is theoretically impossible to reduce poverty through redistribution in countries where average income falls below US$ 700 per year.
OECD study signified that even in developed countries, redistribution schemes cannot be the only response to rising poverty rates in certain segments of the populace.
Inclusive growth means economic growth that creates employment opportunities and helps in reducing poverty.
It means having access to essential services in health and education by the poor. It includes providing equality of opportunity, empowering people through education and skill development.
It also encompasses a growth process that is environment friendly growth, aims for good governance and helps in creation of a gender sensitive society.

World Economic Forum on social inclusion and economic growth
Firstly, governments should develop the capacity of their citizens in public and private investment, and that is the most essential way of sustainably increasing the pace of growth in productivity.
Secondly, governments should modernize national labour regulations and institutions cooperation with employers’ and workers’ groups. This affects the amount and distribution of employment and remuneration opportunities, hence the purchasing power level and aggregate demand in the economy.
Third, governments should enhance public and private investment to provide broader social benefits in labour-intensive economic sectors. These include sustainable infrastructure for water, electricity, digital infrastructure, transport, healthcare, rural economy, education, and training.

Reasons for Inequality in India
The following can be listed as the reasons for inequality in India.

Historical reasons: Discrimination against certain sections of the society since historic times. This has affected their choice, opportunity, and accessibility to education, employment and health. Though policies like Reservation have been implemented since Independence, they were successful only in the economic and political sphere that too to a limited section of people but failed largely in social upliftment.
Females were always treated to be subordinate and weaker to males. Girl education is considered to be a burden on the family and women have limited choices in employment.
Large-scale informal employment: 80% of the Indian labour force is employed in the informal sector. Informal sector jobs are more insecure without regular pay and social security benefits. This increases the wage gap between formal and informal sectors.
A huge proportion of the population is still dependent on agriculture but the share of agriculture to the total GDP is falling.
Inter-state inequalities: Growth has been different across sectors and regions. For examples, Green Revolution has disproportionately benefitted Western and Southern India when compared to Eastern India.
Studies show that globalization and opening up the economy has benefited the rich more than the poor, thus raising the inequality. Global platforms like WTO have resulted in increased trade competitiveness affecting the returns of local investors and producers.
According to the paper by famous Economist Thomas Piketty, tax progressivity which is a tool to contain the rise in inequality was progressively reduced. Wage inequality dispersion also increased in many sectors, as privatizations removed government-set pay scales, which were less unequal.
Lack of skill development and jobless growth.


Dimensions of Inclusive Growth
Equality:

Equality of opportunity in terms of access to markets, resources, and unbiased regulatory environment are the ends to mean of equality. In-equalities exist in various manners which are social inequalities, rural-urban divide, regional disparities, digital divide etc.

To realize the Inclusive Growth in its ultimate form, equality is the most fundamental criteria. Inclusive Growth and equality impact each other.
Without equality, Inclusive Growth can’t be achieved and lack of Inclusive Growth may lead to in-equality in real or perceived forms. Thus, Inclusive Growth and equality are mutually reinforcing. In contemporary economic environment, gender equality has become a basic element of Inclusive Growth.
Although Indian economy has progressed, the equality has retrograded at all levels whether social or economic. An OECD report has identified that inequality in India has been continuously rising which has posed policy challenges in promotion of inclusiveness.


Good Governance:

Good governance results in effectiveness and efficiency, it upholds justice in the rule of law, and accountability and it encourages popular participation, consensus, and equality.

Tenth nes governance in following way: “Governance relates to the management of all such processes that, in any society, define the environment which permits and enables individuals to raise their capability levels, on one hand, and provide opportunities to realise their potential and enlarge the set of available choices, on the other”
Good governance is the mechanism for integrating Inclusive Growth, public administration and accountability towards envisaged outcome; for example, problems in poor health infrastructure may be an impediment to Inclusive Growth and can often be traced back to poor governance of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
So, good governance provides a common platform for all actors and adapts to sustain the socio-economic transformation which is a pre-requisite of Inclusive Growth. Private governance also highlights the role of private sector in meeting the demand of capital, resource and skills required for Inclusive Growth.


Decentralization:

Empowering local self-governing institutions is one of the delivery mechanisms of the Inclusive Growth. 73rd and 74th amendments of the constitutions are innovation in the field of Indian Polity.

Centre and state govt. have to empower the PRIs to make them enabler of Inclusive Growth.
In this regard, the eleventh devised a Devolution Index to be called PRI-Empowerment Index. Without decentralization, it is a daunting task to implement the Inclusive Growth based policies.
Decentralization of rural governance is critical for achieving Inclusive Growth. The present level of decentralization, institutional structure is inadequate.
The following are the deficiencies in decentralization that limit the Inclusive Growth potential:

Lack of finance, proper institutions and delegation of roles and responsibilities.
Divergence in central and state approaches in programs and welfare schemes.
Incoherence in organization at national and state level.
Poor accountability, transparency and monitoring mechanism.


Accountability and Transparency:

Accountability is answerability towards performance of service delivery. It sets in the responsibility towards the assigned tasks in terms of results and outcome.

Accountability is specified both in vertically and horizontally. The former refers to the departmental hierarch in a govt. institutions and the latter refers to the autonomous agencies for check and balances on govt. activities e.g. CAG, PMO etc.
Transparency is necessary for efficient delivery of essential public services; it acts as an enabler for citizens in accessing information on demand which helps them in reinstating their claims on government endowments and entitlements meant for them.
Lack of accountability and transparency has earmarked the governance in India with red-tapism, bureaucracy and corruption. Govt. has put efforts in multifarious manners to curb the menace. Citizen Charter, Right To Information, Central Vigilance Commission etc. are revolutionary efforts, inasmuch the poor monitoring of their implementation has put a constraint of the efficacy of such ideas.


Sustainability:

In long term, it has been identified that, there has been a gross mismatch between the outcomes of the Indian Economic for Inclusive Growth with respect to environment.

Although, Indian economy has witnessed a rapid growth, there has been a decline in the environment and standard of living of the poor. In the issues related to Inclusive Growth as discussed ahead, it has been elaborated that Liberalization, Privatization and Globalization (LPG) has put a sheer pressure on the environment and created a rural-urban divide. Sustainability and Inclusive Growth can’t be achieved in isolation and they supplement each other.
Without adopting a sustainable practice in Inclusive Growth, the implementation of Inclusive Growth policies is bound to falter. Sustainability is required at the following levels when charting out the policy framework for Inclusive Growth:
Financial Sustainability: The Inclusive Growth programs and projects of the govt. should be financially viable. It may be noticed that excess of subsidy and lack of outcome orientation is causing a problem of increasing fiscal deficit.
Social Sustainability: Social sustainability means the need to maintain and sustain specific structure and culture. This type of problem is typically prevalent in tribal areas where the development programs for economic growth come in conflict with the cultural sentiments of the tribal population.
Environment Sustainability: In long-term, the environment standards must not be jeopardized while in pursuit of Inclusive Growth. By excess use of fertilizer is a die-hard need of the moment, at the same time it has led to is unique problem of depletion of soil productivity and technology fatigue.


Measuring Inclusive Growth
Inclusive Development Index (IDI)
In the Inclusive Development Index (IDI) compiled by the World Economic Forum (WEF), India ranked 62nd out of 74 emerging countries and was among the least inclusive countries in Group of 20 (G-20) countries.
The IDI is based on the idea that most people base their country’s growth not on GDP but by their own standard of living.
It gives a measure of inequality based on three parameters:
Growth and development
Inclusion
Inter-generational equity and sustainability.
India also did not make it to the top 10 most inclusive emerging and developing economies, where its neighbours Nepal, China and Sri Lanka made a mark.
India performed its best in terms of “intergenerational equity and sustainability”, ranking 44th, for which credit can be attributed to its demographic dividend.


Social Progress Index (SPI)
It is an aggregate index of social and environmental indicators which includes the following:
Basic human need
Foundation of well being
Opportunity
Limitation of other indices:

GDP: It does not include non-market activities- Excludes factors like environment, equality, etc.
Gini Coefficient: Only income inequalities are included and other inequalities like social inequality, equality of opportunities, etc. are ignored.
Gross Happiness Index: Ignores gender neutrality, education, etc.
HDI: The unequal distribution of wealth is igored.
Benefits of SPI:

SPI measures the outcomes of the government measures rather than money spent. It also takes account of efficiency by which money spent by the government has been used.
It is more comprehensive.


Global Slavery Index
It is released by the Walk Free Foundation of Australia.
Modern Slavery means a situation where one person has taken away another person’s freedom, to control their body so that they can be exploited.
Factors responsible for modern slavery:

Absence of rights
Lack of physical safety
Access to necessities such as health care, education, food, etc.
Pattern of migration
Government actions to reduce modern slavery: India has worked in the right direction by criminalizing trafficking, slavery, forced labour, child prostitution, and child marriage.


Experience of India in ushering in Inclusive growth since independence
Independence brought dreams of not just individual, but also economic, social and political freedom. Seventy- four years later, these ideals have undergone a transformation as India seeks to join the $5 trillion club.
The recognition of the significance of inclusive growth in developing Asia have been generated by a rising concern that the benefits of remarkable economic growth have not been equitably shared.
India set up the Commission in 1950 to oversee the entire range of  including resource allocation, implementation and appraisal of five-year e five-year e centralized economic and social growth programmes
Developing India experienced rapid economic growth during the last two decades. Asia’s rapid growth has led to dramatic reduction in the level of extreme poverty.
Within the context of India, the Indian economy, which has undergone various phases since last many decades is currently enter an altogether different path, one marked by a high rate of expansion, combined with ‘inclusive growth.’
In the last few years, inclusive growth has been at the vanguard of studies supported by multilateral aid agencies, such as the United Nations, the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and several nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).
In India, governments have introduced several projects, such as Jawahar Rozgar Yojna, Integrated Rural Development Program, Rural Housing Scheme, Swarnjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana and Mahatama Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act to promote inclusive growth.
Nonetheless, to boost inclusive growth in a country with the scale and size of India, private sector involvement is equally important. The private sector has started contributing with initiatives, such as the ICICI Foundation having been established with the purpose of promoting inclusive growth.
The government and private sector both have imperative roles in driving inclusive growth. There is a need for the public and the private sector in India to have a combined approach towards how they can extend, innovate, and cooperate in innovative ways to enhance inclusive growth.

Measures taken by India since independence to ensure inclusive growth in the economy
Components of Inclusive Growth – 11th 5year ess to essential services
Employment Generation
Women empowerment
Good governance
Skill building
Equality of opportunity
Poverty Reduction


Inclusive Growth and 12th Five Year e ment begins with anticipating three economic scenarios at the end of the 12th se three scenarios are “Strong inclusive growth”, “Insufficient action” and “Policy Logjam”.
The first one viz. Strong inclusive growth is the most optimistic one but needs effective implementation and a robust government.
The ment discusses the following aspects of inclusiveness:

Inclusiveness as Poverty Reduction: So that adequate flow of benefits to the poor and the most marginalised.
Inclusiveness as Group Equality: The poor are certainly one target group, but inclusiveness must also embrace the concern of other groups such as the Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), Other Backward Classes (OBCs), Minorities, women, the differently abled and other marginalised groups.
Inclusiveness as Regional Balance: This aspect of inclusiveness relates to whether all States, and indeed all regions, are seen to benefit from the growth process. Improvement in infrastructure must therefore be an important component of any regionally inclusive development strategy.
Inclusiveness as Reducing Inequality: There is a need to keep inequality into tolerable limits.
Inclusiveness as Empowerment: The ment says that inclusiveness is not just about ensuring a broad-based flow of benefits or economic opportunities; it is also about empowerment and participation.
Inclusiveness through Employment Programmes: The document stresses on the quality of assets created, which will determine whether MGNREGA can go beyond the safety net to become a springboard for entrepreneurship, even at the lowest income levels.


NITI Aayog’s Strategy for inclusive growth:

New India @75 vision has the following objectives for the inclusive growth:

To have a rapid growth, which reaches 9-10% by 2022-23, which is inclusive, clean, sustained and formalized.
To Leverage technology for inclusive, sustainable and participatory development by 2022-23.
To have an inclusive development in the cities to ensure that urban poor and slum dwellers including recent migrants can avail city services.
To make schools more inclusive by addressing the barriers related to the physical environment (e.g. accessible toilets), admission procedures as well as curriculum design.
To make higher education more inclusive for the most vulnerable groups.
To provide quality ambulatory services for an inclusive package of diagnostic, curative, rehabilitative and palliative care, close to the people.
To prepare an inclusive policy framework with citizens at the centre.


Policy Approaches for Inclusive Growth:

As far as the policy framework is concerned, the govt. lacks a suitable policy vis-a-vis Inclusive Growth. Nonetheless, the govt. has experimented with various models of Inclusive Growth.

According to World Bank’s review of India’s Development Policy, Inclusive Growth policy implementation is facing a dilemma of improving the delivery of core public services, and maintaining rapid growth while spreading the benefits of this growth more widely.

The strategy for the inclusive growth per needs to be an integrating strategy comprising state, market, civil societies and common man.

Since independence, the govt. has practiced various types of policy measures, a few are discussed ahead:



Growth oriented policy:

India’s economic started with growth oriented policy. First 1-56) was started with an objective of rapid and balanced growth.
The second 6-61) also put a thrust on rapid growth of industrialization. More recent, twelfth five year 7-12) has blended economic growth with inclusion with an objective of Faster,
Sustainable and More Inclusive Growth. Arvind Virmani, ex-chief economic advisor to govt. of India has divided the policy approaches for economic growth in following phases:
Phase 1: 1950-1 to 1979-80 (two sub-phases: 1950 50-65 to 1966-79)
Phase 2: 1980-81 to 1993-94 (change in policy regime, reform initiation and structural adjustment in the economic policy.)
Phase 3: 1994-5 to onwards (Statistical significant growth break (1994-5) and rising growth trend)
The rate of economic growth has increased with time, particularly in phase 3, which is a result of radical reforms during 1990s.
However, it has failed to emphasize inclusive growth by creating more jobs for low and semi-skilled workers. Growth is not equally shared and in many parts of the country, people still remain poor and disadvantaged in significant proportion.


Direct intervention:

The direct intervention is facilitating the Inclusive Growth through legislation, regulation, credit facilitation and providing livelihood security are the forms of direct intervention by the govt.
Now, the orientation of administrative machinery is transformed from regulator to facilitator. Govt. direct intervention from the perspective of Inclusive Growth now be seen in making available the requisite social investment, establishing independent regulatory institutional mechanism, drafting incentive based policy and encouraging entrepreneurial innovation.
Safety nets or anti-poverty measures are the some other ways of direct intervention of the govt. towards Inclusive Growth.


Capacity Building:

Skill development is basically capacity development. However, capacity development is not only limited to skill building or entrepreneurial innovation.
Capacity development through training of rural development functionaries is also a mean of capacity building. Now, creating job and market demand is not the only criteria of capacity development.
Increasing efficiency, effectiveness, accountability and transparency are also considered the areas under capacity building initiatives of the govt. For example, if the objective of Department of Rural Development is enhancing the livelihood security of households in rural areas though MNREGA then capacity building for enhancing effectiveness of Gram Sabha is one of the modalities to achieve the objective.


Welfare schemes:

Food subsidies, public distribution of essential commodities, nutrition programs, financial support though micro finance are examples of the ways in which welfare schemes are implemented.
For different types of beneficiaries (women, Children, BPL etc.) central and state govt. have come with the customized welfare schemes. The approach in welfare schemes is to benefit the beneficiaries through optimal allocation of resources and access to essential services.
Integrated Child Development Scheme is a type of welfare scheme with children and women as beneficiaries. It is India’s flagship scheme for the nutritional and developmental needs of children.


Public Participation:

Without public participation at different level of governance, Inclusive Growth remains a distant dream. Govt. is encouraging the public participation in multifarious ways towards which the common man must show an affirmative and pro-active response.
SHGs promotion is a typical example of public participation for Inclusive Growth. Govt. can provide the supporting platform for citizen centric services, the responsibility to deliver still is of the common man.
SHGs support and promotion programs have yielded good results in South Indian states, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh particularly. Kerala govt. supported Kudumbasree programme have been successful in women empowerment and reducing poverty. Similar initiative of Andhra Pradesh namely ‘Indira Kranti Pathakam’ is showing a good progress in social mobilization, gender empowerment and rural poverty reduction.
Lastly, policy intervention takes place both at micro and macro level. Improving fiscal discipline, trade liberalization, promoting Foreign Direct Investment, privatization, deregulation, tax reforms, labour laws, social safety nets, public expenditure etc. are important for macro policy measures while at the micro level, reducing inequality in income, improving public/social infrastructure, healthcare, education, access to essential services, accountability and transparency, women empowerment, role of civil society organizations, etc are instrument of micro policy which needs to be re-worked.



Reasons why India has not been able to achieve inclusive growth in the economy
Growth vs. Development
Over a period since economic reforms, India’s economic growth has witnessed a mixed effect on the real development.
GDP is considered the key parameter of economic growth. In reality, the increasing GDP growth rate has not trickled down to the bottom of pyramid.
A research study carried by Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, an autonomous think-tank under Reserve Bank of India find out that economic growth has “trickled down” in both rural and urban areas; it has not been in favour of the poor.
In urban areas, growth has been “anti-poor.” BPL and poor of the poor still remains marginalized. Such issues are quite fundamental in nature as they depict the lack of clarity in the vision and strategy of the policy.
It is time, to put the Inclusive Growth as the central agenda of the economic growth.


Defining Poor
Who are poor and who should be the beneficiaries of the welfare schemes? Without a proper criterion of poverty, proper policy framework for inclusive growth cannot be developed.
Efforts have been put taking calorie values, wages etc. as criteria of defining poverty line.
The lacuna of poverty definition also impacts the other associated areas such as employment schemes and subsidies for the poor.
All this have repercussions on inclusive growth. Govt. is gung-ho on the observation the reducing rate of poverty which has come down to the level of 35% but the inequality has increased at the same time.


Fiscal Deficit
Development schemes run by the govt. have created a dilemma of expanding fiscal deficit.
India’s current fiscal deficit situation has limited the prospect of development schemes.
India has significantly high debt to GDP ratio, balance of trade (negative) and current account deficit (CAD).
Last year’s estimates were: fiscal deficit: 5.2% of GDP; CAD: USD 92 billion; stimulus package: Rs. 1.84 lakh crore (3% of GDP). The govt. has set a target of reducing fiscal deficit to the level of 3 per cent by 2016-17.
Fiscal deficit also creates the problem of inflation which in turn makes the poor even more vulnerable.
Increasing CAD is comparatively more detrimental to INCLUSIVE GROWTH than fiscal deficit.


Ill-effects of LPG:
Liberalization, privatization and globalization of Indian economy has ushered the poor to vulnerability and irony.
Liberalization and privatization have particularly suited to the Indian private corporate, elites and rich. Globalization has created a question of existence in-front of small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
Have a look at the plight of the women employed in the cotton fields of northern India. Now, India’s share of textile industries in world trade is remarkably low.
All this have limited the growth potential and created the problem of unemployment. The malfunctioning of LPG in Indian scenario has surmounted new issues viz. gender inequality and threat to women empowerment.


Social-injustice:
Government is gung-ho on their efforts of reducing the poverty rate; even the UN’s MDG report affirms that India’s poverty rate is expected to fall to 22% by 2015 from 51% in 1990.
At the same time, there are other chronicle issues which have magnified over a period e.g. child malnutrition.
Poor skilling and professional competencies; Lack women’s in mainstream economic activities; Poor nutritional, health and educational indicators
A Hunger and Malnutrition Survey 2011 revealed something shocking; in the 100 focus districts with the poorest child development indicators, over 40 per cent of children were underweight and almost 60 per cent stunted.
Regional Disparities; Inadequate infrastructure; Social inequality and discrimination
Citing the report, the PM lamented: the problem of malnutrition a matter of national shame. Rich have become richer and poor have become poorer, marginalized are even more ignored, also, poverty has concentrated more in backward classes, minority, SCs and STs.


Infrastructure:
Infrastructure is fundamental to the economic and inclusive growth. In budgetary allocations, Infrastructure is assigned the highest expenditure. Major proportion of this allocation goes to large projects such as power generation, freight corridors, and airports etc.
While rural infrastructure is immensely neglected. In many areas, the lack of proper infrastructure is acute.
Major thrust of the infrastructural development of the govt. has been from view of industrial development. Agriculture, for an instance, has always lacked the focus. Infrastructure to support and facilitate backward linkages in agriculture e.g. cold storage houses, processing facilities, rural transport is need of the hour.
Apart from that, the rural-urban divide in infrastructure development has become prominent.
For a case in point, Eleventh gnizes that: It is an irony that the phenomenal growth in the telecom sector has also created a digital divide in terms of mobile and land line connections and Internet and broadband connections between urban and rural India.
The  highlights the dearth of rural electrification and observes that rural electrification an important instrument to bring about inclusive growth by making electricity available to farmers and in rural areas. 7.8 crore rural households still remains un-electrified.


Low Technology and Innovation:
Indian economy is suffering from a technology-lag vis-a-vis developed economies and other industrialized economies. Poor rate of technology and innovation creates a burden on capital and resource base.
India’s agricultural productivity is far below to that of developed countries. Agriculture is mainstay of the economic growth and a source to unskilled work-force employment.
The rapid technological development in primary activities such as agriculture creates a question of economic duality in front of the policy makers of the country. This means, if a high rate of technology is adopted in primary sector industry, then it may lead to high rate of unemployment, but at the same time, without technological progress, the productivity would be less to sustain the pressure on the economy.
Considering this, there is an immediate requirement of technologies such as green technology, environmentally friendly technologies and renewable energy technology etc. so that the pressure on natural resources may be overcome.
Policy makers have to address the economic duality judiciously. Apart from that, the innovation per se is required to be a harbinger of Inclusive Growth which is broad sense is termed as inclusive innovation.
Inclusive innovation means the creation and absorption of product and services relevant to the poor. In this case, SMEs, MSMEs and grass root innovation enabling agencies such as National Innovation Foundation can play a decisive role. Finance, competency and infrastructure are the foundation for inclusive innovation and enabler for Inclusive Growth.
