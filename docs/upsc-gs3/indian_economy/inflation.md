## Inflation in India

India calculates its inflation on two price indices, i.e., the wholesale price index (WPI) and the consumer price index (CPI). While the WPI-inflation is used at the macro-level policymaking, the CPI-inflation is used for micro-level analyses. **The inflation at the WPI is the inflation of the economy.**

::: warning Concept

- Wholesale Price Index is the inflation of the economy.
  :::

#### Wholesale Price Index

- The new series of the WPI was released by the Government with the revised base year as 2011– 12.
- It combinines the Food Articles (belonging to the group Primary Articles) and Food Products (belonging to the group Manufactured Products).
- WPI continues to constitute three major groups—
  - **Primary Articles,**
  - **Fuel and Power**, and
  - **Manufactured Products**
- The prices used for WPI <text style="color:red"> **do not include Indirect Taxes**</text> in order to remove impact of fiscal policy.
- A new Wholesale Food Price Index (WPFI) has been introduced— combining the Food Articles (belonging to the group Primary Articles) and Food Products (belonging to the group Manufactured Products).

#### Major Groups of WPI by Weightage in %

## Consumer Price Index

- India has been measuring inflation at the consumer prices also besides at the wholesale prices. But in place of a single consumer price index (CPI), India was managing with four differing set of the CPIs due to the socio-economic differentiations found among the consumers (i.e., people’s choices of consumption and their purchasing power).
  -In 2011-12, the government announced a new set of consumer indices:
  - **CPI-R** for the rural market, - **CPI-U** - for the urban market, and - **CPI-C** - by combining them a National CPI. The national consumer price index is called CPI-C (where ‘C’ stands for Combined).
- The base year has been changed from 2010 to 2012

## Definition of Inflation

- Inflation happens when prices rise across the economy. Goods and services such as food, gas, rent, and clothing are usually where people feel inflation the most.
- But prices can change for different reasons, in different ways, and at different speeds. Prices may change because a good or service is in higher demand or there have been significant impacts to supply. Larger shocks to the economy such as stock market crashes, pandemics, or war can also impact pricing.
- Each instance of inflation is different. However, the general principle can be understood by looking at three key characteristics of inflationary forces: the pace, the cause, and how it is measured.

Two terms are used to show a fall in general level of prices— disinflation and deflation. But these terms have very specific meanings in terms of price fall— while disinflation is considered good for the economy (as it brings comfort to the consumers), deflation is not considered good (as it invites the risks of slowdown and even recession in the economy).

::: tip Key Takeways

- Inflation describes a situation in which prices across an economy are rising, where the cost of goods, services, and raw materials are increasing.
- Inflation can vary in pace, from creeping inflation of 1% per year to the kind of hyperinflation seen in Germany in the 1930s.
- Inflation has various causes and can occur in a number of different ways.
- Inflation can also be measured in different ways: by looking at the standard prices that consumers pay, or by considering the price of individual commodities.

## Types of Inflation


<img src="/upsc-gs3/indian_economy/illustration/types-of-inflation.webp"
         alt="Capital Expenditure "
         width="600" height="">
 

### Inflation by Pace

The speed of inflation can vary a lot. In some cases, prices increase by a manageable 2% a year, encouraging individuals to invest their money to maintain its value. In other cases, inflation can happen catastrophically fast, or even go into reverse.

##### 1. Creeping Inflation

Creeping, or mild, inflation occurs when prices rise slowly. According to the RBI, when prices increase by 2% or less, it benefits economic growth. This kind of mild inflation makes consumers expect that prices will keep going up, which boosts demand. Consumers buy now in order to beat higher future prices, and so mild inflation drives economic expansion.

##### 2. Walking Inflation

This type of inflation is faster than creeping inflation, but not as fast as galloping or hyperinflation. It is harmful to the economy because it heats up economic growth too quickly. People start to buy more than they need in order to avoid tomorrow's much higher prices. This increased buying drives demand even further, and suppliers often can't keep up. More importantly, neither can most people’s wages. As a result, you can be priced out of common goods and services.

#### 3. Galloping Inflation

When inflation rises to 10% or more, it can be very damaging to the economy. Money loses value so quickly that business and employee income can't keep up with costs and prices. Foreign investors, in turn, avoid the country where this occurs, depriving it of needed capital. The economy becomes unstable, and government leaders lose credibility. For this reason, avoiding galloping inflation is a key objective of many central banks.

#### 4. Hyperinflation

Hyperinflation occurs when prices skyrocket by more than 50% per month. It is very rare. In fact, most examples of hyperinflation occur when governments print money to pay for wars. One of the most extreme examples is Hungary, where in 1945, prices doubled every 15 hours. Venezuela has been fighting a bout of hyperinflation since the early 2010s.


<img src="/upsc-gs3/indian_economy/illustration/hyperinflation.webp"
         alt="Capital Expenditure "
         width="600" height="">

 Hyperinflation:  
Hyperinflation occurs when the prices of goods and services rise more than 50% per month. At that rate, a loaf of bread could cost one amount in the morning and a higher one in the afternoon.

Hyperinflation is very rare. In 2022, the U.S. has experienced heightened inflation; as of May 2022, consumer prices have risen around 8% year-over-year.1 Although this uptick is alarming, and indeed has had serious consequences for many Americans, it is a long way off from hyperinflation.

The severity of cost increases distinguishes it from the other types of inflation. The next worst, known as galloping inflation, sends prices up 10% or more per year.

Causes of Hyperinflation
Hyperinflation has two main causes: an increase in the money supply and demand-pull inflation. The former happens when a country's government begins printing money to pay for its spending. As it increases the money supply, prices rise as in regular inflation.

The other cause, demand-pull inflation, occurs when a surge in demand outstrips supply, sending prices higher. This can happen due to increased consumer spending due to a growing economy, a sudden rise in exports, or more government spending.

The two often go hand-in-hand. Instead of tightening the money supply to stop inflation, the government or central bank might continue to print more money. With too much currency sloshing around, prices skyrocket. Once consumers realize what is happening, they expect continued inflation. They buy more now to avoid paying a higher price later. That excessive demand aggravates inflation. It's even worse if consumers stockpile goods and create shortages.

::: danger Key Takeways

- When prices soar over 50% in one month, the economy is experiencing hyperinflation.
- Hyperinflation can be caused by a government that prints more money than its nation’s GDP can support.
- Hyperinflation tends to occur during a period of economic turmoil or depression.
- Demand-pull inflation can also cause hyperinflation.
- Some examples of hyperinflation include Germany, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and the Confederacy during the Civil War.

:::

#### Effects of Hyperinflation

When hyperinflation is in effect, consumer behavior adjusts. To keep from paying more for goods tomorrow, people begin hoarding today. That stockpiling creates shortages. Hoarding can start with durable goods, such as automobiles and washing machines. If hyperinflation continues, people hoard perishable goods, like bread and milk. These daily supplies become scarce, and more expensive, and the economy falls apart.

People lose their savings as cash loses its value. For that reason, the elderly are often the most vulnerable to hyperinflation. Soon, banks and lenders go bankrupt, because their loans lose value. They run out of cash as people stop making deposits.

Hyperinflation sends the value of the currency plummeting in foreign exchange markets. The nation's importers go out of business as the cost of foreign goods skyrockets. Unemployment rises as companies fold. Government tax revenues fall and it has trouble providing basic services. The government prints more money to pay its bills, worsening the hyperinflation.3

There are two winners in hyperinflation. The first beneficiaries are those who took out loans and find that the collapsing value of the currency makes their debt worthless by comparison until it is virtually wiped out. Exporters are also winners because the falling value of the local currency makes exports cheaper compared to foreign competitors. Additionally, exporters receive hard foreign currency, which increases in value as the local currency falls.

#### What happens to debt during periods of hyperinflation?

Hyperinflation makes debt expensive for new borrowers. Fewer lenders will be willing to offer debt as economic conditions sour, so borrowers will be expected to pay higher interest rates. On the other hand, if someone takes on debt before hyperinflation begins, then the borrower benefits because the value of the currency falls. In theory, it should be easier to pay back a set sum of cash, because the borrower can earn more for their goods and services.

#### What happens to real estate during hyperinflation?

Real estate prices may rise rapidly during a period of hyperinflation. Property values may not move in perfect correlation with inflation trends, but they are an asset, and the cost of most assets could be expected to rise in inflationary environments.

This form of inflation is ‘large and accelerating’ which might have the annual rates in million or even trillion. In such inflation not only the range of increase is very large, but the increase takes place in a very short span of time, prices shoot up overnight. The best example of hyperinflation that economists cite is of Germany after the First World War— in early 1920s. At the end of 1923, prices were 36 billion times higher than two years earlier. This inflation was so severe that paper German currencies (the Deutsche Mark) were more valuable as stove fuel than as actual money. Some recent examples of hyperinflation had been the Bolivian inflation of mid-1985 (24,000 per cent per annum) and the Yugoslavian inflation of 1993 (20 per cent per day). The latest example has been Venezuela which saw an annual inflation of over 53 million per cent by 2019, as per its central bank. The currency of Zimbabwe was declared worthless (by the magazine The Economist) in wake of rise in annual inflation to 90 billion trillion per cent by 2008. Such an inflation quickly leads to a complete loss of confidence in the domestic currency and people start opting for other forms of money, as for example physical assets, gold and foreign currency (also known as ‘inflation proof’ assets) and people might switch to barter exchange.

#### 5. Deflation

Inflation can also go into reverse; this is a situation in which prices are decreasing. This can happen, for instance, when an asset bubble bursts. This is known as deflation. Once deflation starts, it is harder to stop than inflation. It can be damaging to an economy because people will put off purchases because they are waiting for lower prices.

That's what happened to the housing market in 2006. Deflation in housing prices meant many people who had bought their homes a few years before the decline found their house was now worth less than the value of their mortgage.

### Inflation by Cause

Inflation can be caused by a wide variety of factors. If a government prints a lot of money to pay its debts, as happened in Germany in the 1930s, this can lead to a widespread decrease in the value of money, leading to inflation. In other instances, the causes of inflation are not as well defined.

#### 1. Demand-Pull Inflation

In economics, it’s possible to distinguish between two types of inflation: demand-pull inflation and cost-push inflation.

**Demand-pull inflation** occurs when the need for goods and services is higher than the available capacity required to meet it. This would make the in-demand product or service more expensive.
Demand-pull inflation is the most common cause of rising prices. It occurs when consumer demand for goods and services increases so much that it outstrips supply. Producers, meanwhile, can't make enough to meet demand and may not have time to build the manufacturing needed to boost supply. They also may not have enough skilled workers to make it, or the raw materials might be scarce.2

If sellers don't raise the price, they will sell out and eventually come to realize they now have the luxury of hiking up prices. If enough sellers do this, they create inflation.

There are several circumstances that create demand-pull inflation. For example, a growing economy affects inflation because when people get better jobs and become more confident, they spend more.

As prices rise, people start to expect inflation. That expectation motivates consumers to spend more now to avoid future price increases. That further boosts growth. For this reason, a little inflation is good. Most central banks recognize this. They set an inflation target to manage the public's expectation of inflation. The U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve, has set a target of 2% as measured by the core inflation rate. The core rate removes the effect of seasonal food and energy cost increases.1

Another circumstance is discretionary fiscal policy, which is when the government either spends more or taxes less. Putting extra money in people's pockets increases demand and spurs inflation.

##### Factors of Demand-Pull Inflation

There are a few key factors that can play roles in causing demand-pull inflation, as outlined below.

##### Marketing and New Technology

These factors create demand-pull inflation for specific products or asset classes. The asset inflation that results can drive widespread price increases. For example, Apple uses branding to create demand for its products, which allows it to command higher prices than the competition.

Asset inflation also helped spark the housing market crisis. New technology had become popular, leading to a rise in the sale of financial derivatives. These new products created a boom-and-bust cycle in the housing market in 2005. As demand for housing was spurred on by a sudden surge in these products, housing construction labor inflated quickly, setting up a crash in construction labor when the asset bubble burst and housing demand plummeted.3

##### Expansionary Fiscal Policy

Expanding the money supply can also create demand-pull inflation. When the money supply expands, it lowers the value of the dollar. When the dollar declines relative to the value of foreign currencies, the prices of imports rise. That increases prices in the general economy.

The money supply can increase through expansionary fiscal policy, which is enacted by the federal government. These policies expand the money supply by pumping money into certain segments of the economy, creating demand-pull inflation in those areas.

The government stimulus programs enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic are good examples of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. As inflation began to rise rapidly in 2021 and 2022, many economists agreed that these expansionary policies, which put a significant amount of cash in Americans' pockets, had played at least a partial role in driving up prices.4

::: danger Note
Occasionally, the government can create inflation simply by printing more cash. Venezuela did this between 2013 and 2019, creating hyperinflation, and its money effectively became worthless.
:::

##### Expansionary Monetary Policy

The RBI controls expansionary monetary policy, which is another way to increase the money supply. The RBI expands the money flowing through the economy by creating more credit with the use of its many tools.

One tool is lowering the fed funds rate, which is what banks charge each other to borrow funds. This action also lowers all interest rates, which allows borrowers to take out bigger loans for the same cost. When loans become too cheap, too much money chases too few goods and creates inflation. Prices increase across the board, even though neither demand nor supply has changed.

It's <mark> important to note that changes in fiscal or monetary policy don't automatically cause inflation</mark> . Ultimately, demand-pull inflation results from a complex interplay of many factors, and these policies are usually meant to interact with those factors to control inflation.

#### 2. Cost-push inflation

- It occurs when it becomes more expensive to produce goods or provide services. This can be caused by rapidly increasing wages or material costs.
- It only occurs when there is a supply shortage combined with enough demand to allow the producer to raise prices.
- When a country lowers its currency's exchange rates, this can also create cost-push inflation in imports. That makes foreign goods more expensive compared to locally produced goods.
- There are several contributors to inflation on the supply side. For example, global supply chain disruptions, like the one caused by the pandemic in 2020, can lead to cost-push inflation.
- Monopolies can also contribute to cost-push inflation because a monopoly controls the entire supply of a good or service.
- Natural disasters create temporary cost-push inflation by damaging production facilities. In general, the depletion of natural resources is a growing cause of cost-push inflation. For example, overfishing has reduced the supply of seafood and driven up prices.
- Government regulation and taxation can also reduce supplies.
- When a country lowers its currency's exchange rates, this can also create cost-push inflation in imports. That makes foreign goods more expensive compared to locally produced goods.

#### 3. Stagflation

- Stagflation occurs when economic growth is stagnant but prices continue to rise.
- This combination seems contradictory, but it happened in the 1970s when the United States abandoned the gold standard. Once the dollar's value was no longer tied to gold, it plummeted. At the same time, the price of gold skyrocketed.

::: danger Key Takeways

- There are two major types of inflation: demand-pull and cost-push.
- Demand-pull inflation occurs when consumers have more money to spend or are otherwise encouraged to purchase products and services.
- Cost-pull inflation happens when supply decreases and producers raise prices to offset their costs of production.
  :::

## Measures of Inflation

Just as inflation can happen at different paces and have different causes, it can also be measured in a variety of ways.

#### 1. Core Inflation

- The core inflation rate measures rising prices in everything except food and energy. That's because food and gas prices tend to be very volatile, and including them in inflation measures can give an inaccurate impression of how prices are fluctuating within an economy.
- The RBI uses the core inflation rate to guide it in setting monetary policy. The RBI doesn't want to adjust interest rates without significant evidence that everything is becoming more expensive.

#### 2. Asset Inflation

Asset inflation also refers to rising prices, but in a more limited way. Instead of prices rising across a wide range of goods, asset inflation refers to the price of a particular asset increasing. Examples of assets that can be subject to inflation are housing, oil, and gold.

#### 3. Shrinkflation

- A more unofficial measure of inflation is shrinkflation. Shrinkflation refers to the reduction of a package’s contents as a result of high inflation.
- Manufacturers provide less of a product in each package instead of raising the price. That means you pay more in the long run because you’re getting less of the product, while manufacturers save money on supply costs.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What does inflation do to the economy?
Low inflation—around 2%—is believed to be beneficial to the economy, because it stimulates demand. If inflation climbs to more than 10% or becomes deflation, significant economic damage can be done. This is because people won’t be able to afford basic goods or services, or because they will put off purchases to take advantage of lower future prices.

How is inflation measured?
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is one of the most closely watched gauges of inflation. The government calculates this figure by measuring price changes for key goods and services.

How do you hedge against inflation?
Investors have many strategies for how to beat inflation, but as with any investment, there is an element of uncertainty and risk with all inflation hedges. For example, bond investors can hedge for inflation with Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) that automatically adjust payments to account for changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Others try to invest in precious metals or other commodities that could increase in value as inflation rises.

## What Is the Core Inflation Rate?

The core inflation rate is the price change of goods and services minus food and energy. The prices of food and energy products are volatile; they change so quickly that including these categories can skew an accurate reading of the true severity of inflation.

The core inflation rate is synonymous to core CPI and Consumer Price Index (CPI) Less Food and Energy. This exclusion makes the core inflation rate more accurate than the headline inflation rate in measuring underlying inflation trends. This accuracy is why central banks prefer using the core inflation rate when setting monetary policy.

::: tip By the Numbers

:::

#### What Core Inflation Means for You

Although regular inflation—the increase of all items including food and energy products—could certainly have an impact on your day-to-day life by forcing you to tighten your budget, core inflation is the preferred indicator of inflation to the RBI. This means that, if the core inflation rate gets (and stays) too high, RBI will likely raise the rate, thereby increasing interest rates on mortgages, credit cards, and other consumer lending products.

In other words, when the core inflation rate is elevated, not only will consumer items like housing, transportation, and clothing be more expensive, **so too will the cost of borrowing money to purchase those items.**

#### Why Food and Energy Prices Are Volatile

Food and energy prices are volatile because they are traded on the commodities market. Most food (like wheat) and energy (oil, gas, and natural gas) are traded all day long.

For example, commodities traders bid up oil prices if they suspect its supply will fall or demand will rise. They might think a war will dry up the supply of oil. They'll buy oil at today's price to sell at tomorrow's higher anticipated price. That is enough to drive up oil prices. If the war doesn't materialize, oil prices fall when they sell.

How the RBI Uses the Core Inflation Rate
The RBI mandate is to control inflation.

::: Note
The RBI's tools are slow-acting. It can take months before a change in the fed fund rate will filter down to prices.
:::

How does the RBI funds rate affect inflation?
If the RBI funds rate increases, so will the rate for bank loans. As credit tightens, economic growth slows. As a result, companies must lower their prices to stay in business, and that reduces inflation.

The RBI uses inflation-rate targeting.

What happens if the core inflation rate starts to creep above that inflation target and stays there?
The RBI considers raising interest rates and other contractionary monetary policies. The RBI has to weigh this with its other mandate, encouraging economic growth and creating jobs.

#### Why the Core Rate Is Critical

Inflation is when the prices of the goods and services you buy continue to go up over time. If your income doesn't go up at the same rate, you lose buying power as prices rise. The only time inflation doesn't weaken your standard of living is when it happens to your income.

::: tip
Inflation benefits you when prices rise in something you own, like your home or stock portfolio. That's known as asset inflation.
:::

Inflation has a subtle yet destructive effect on economic growth. It's subtle because you may only notice it over time if it's only a 1% or 2% increase. It can have a bit of a positive effect at that rate. Economists theorize that consumers will stock up on goods now because they know the price will rise in the future. This increases demand, which stimulates economic growth.

Over time, high inflation robs the economy of growth potential. If salaries don't keep up, then people are forced to spend more of their income on essentials, like food and gas, and less on other consumer products. Those other businesses become less profitable, and some will close down over time. That can lower the country's economic output.

## What Is the Consumer Price Index?

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a monthly measurement of prices for household goods and services. It reports inflation (rising prices) and deflation (falling prices). Both can hurt a healthy economy.

Definition and an Example of CPI Calculation
The CPI is the measurement used by economists for tracking price changes in a typical "basket" of goods and services that urban consumers buy. The RBI monitors price changes to ensure economic growth remains stable. The RBI uses monetary policy tools to intervene if it detects too much inflation or deflation.

The RBI computes the CPI by taking the average weighted cost of a basket of goods in a given month and dividing it by the weighted cost of the same basket the previous month. It then multiplies this percentage by 100 to get the number for the index.

::: tip Note
The terms CPI and inflation are often used interchangeably because inflation is the percentage increase or decrease of CPI over a certain period of time.
:::

How the CPI Works
The Consumer Price Index represents the prices of a cross-section of goods and services commonly bought by urban households.

Housing is the highest weighted category within the CPI calculation. Shelter uses the concept of "owner's equivalent of primary residence" (OER), which is how much homeowners would charge to rent their home unfurnished, without utilities. The BLS surveys homeowners in multiple urban areas every year to gather this information, replacing one-sixth of the data every year.4

The CPI could give a false low inflation reading due to low rents, even when home prices are high. Low rents can result from fewer renters and increased vacancies, as low interest rates spur more home purchases. At the same time, housing prices could rise due to increased market activity. This is why the CPI didn't warn of asset inflation during the housing bubble of 2005.

::: tip Note
Conversely, rising interest rates might lead to fewer buyers in the market and falling home prices. As more people compete for apartments, rents go up.
:::

The CPI includes sales taxes. It excludes income taxes and the prices of investments, such as stocks and bonds.6

The CPI measures two commodities with wild price swings: food and energy commodities (oil and gasoline). These products are traded constantly on the commodities market. Traders can bid prices up or down based on news such as wars in oil-producing countries or droughts. The CPI often reflects these price swings as a result.

The "core" CPI solves the problem of volatile food and energy prices by excluding them.7 The Fed has considered core CPI in the past when deciding whether to raise the fed funds rate (the interest rate for overnight loans between banks). The core CPI is useful because food, oil, and gas prices are volatile, and the Fed's tools are slow-acting

How Consumer Price Index Affects the RBI
The RBI uses the CPI to determine whether economic policies need to be modified to prevent inflation.

It uses contractionary monetary policy to slow economic growth when it recognizes that the rate of inflation is too high. It changes the interest rate to make loans more expensive, which tightens the money supply—the total amount of credit/money allowed into the market. Slowed growth and demand put downward pressure on prices. This returns the economy to a healthy growth rate of 2% to 3% a year.

How Consumer Price Index Affects Other Government Agencies
The central government uses the CPI to improve benefit levels for recipients of Social Security, MNREGA and other government programs that provide financial assistance.

How Consumer Price Index Affects Housing and Investments
Landlords use the CPI forecasts to determine future rent increases.

An increased CPI can depress bond prices, too. Fixed-income investments tend to lose value during inflation. Investors demand higher yields on these investments to make up for the loss in value as a result.

These yield demands can increase interest rates, which then increases costs for businesses borrowing money to expand. The net effect is a decrease in earnings, which could depress the stock market.

#### Benefits of the CPI

The CPI measures the rate of inflation, which is one of the greatest threats to a healthy economy. Inflation eats away at your standard of living if your income doesn't keep pace with rising prices—your cost of living increases over time.

A high inflation rate can hurt the economy. Everything costs more, so manufacturers produce less and may be forced to lay off workers. The CPI allows us to gauge these factors.

What is the difference between the consumer price index and the GDP deflator?
The CPI attempts to measure the inflation felt by consumers, but the gross domestic product (GDP) deflator measures a wider range of inflationary effects. By accounting for the impact on institutions, such as governments, the GDP deflator makes year-to-year GDP comparisons more accurate.

The rate of inflation is measured on the basis of price indices which are of two kinds— Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI). A price index is a measure of the average level of prices, which means that it does not show the exact price rise or fall of a single good. A price index is a weighted average of the prices of a number of goods and services. In the index the total weight is taken as 100 at a particular year of the past (the base year), this when compared to the current year shows a rise or fall in the prices of current year, there is a rise or fall in the ‘100’ in comparison to the base year— and this inflation is measured in digits.

Measures to Check Inflation

(i) Demand side measure:
In this category mainly, two types of steps are taken. Firstly, the consumers are appealed to cut back the consumption of the items which show higher inflation (called austerity). This step has generally failed across the world because it does not work in case of essential items (such as wheat, rice, milk, tea, etc.) and as people who have money, they don’t wish to cut down consumption. Secondly, the government may tighten flow of money in the system (known as monetary measure)— central bank making money costlier (by increasing repo rate, increasing CRR, etc. in case of India). This step also has its own limitations— it is not effective if the items showing inflation are essential ones (such as wheat, rice, onion, potato, etc. because consumers don’t borrow money from banks to buy them). But it can be quite effective if the items are building materials (interest on home loan can be increased to cut back the demand of these items).

(ii) Supply side measure:
Aimed at increasing the supply of the items showing inflation, the government may go in for upscaling the production or import of the items. This measure also has its own limitations— production may not be upscaled in short-run and import may not reach the country in time. Rather in medium and long-run, production of these items can be upscaled.

(iii) Cost side measure:

Two variety of steps may be taken under it— in short-run cutting taxes can bring in comfort but in the long-run cutting cost of production is the only way out (by scaling up technology).

## Inflation Targeting

The announcement of an Government official target range for inflation is known as inflation targeting. It is done by the Central Bank in an economy as a part of their monetary policy to realise the objective of a stable rate of inflation. India commenced inflation targeting ‘formally’ in February 2015 when an agreement between the GoI and the RBI was signed related to it— the Agreement on Monetary Policy Framework.

The agreement provides the aim of inflation targeting in this way—’ it is essential to have a modern monetary framework to meet the challenge of an increasingly complex economy. Whereas the objective of monetary policy is to primarily maintain price stability, while keeping in mind the objective of growth.

The highlights of the agreement is as given below:

- The RBI will aim to bring CPI-C Inflation below 6 per cent by January 2016.
- The target for financial year 2016– 17 and all subsequent years shall be 4 per cent with a band of +/– 2 per cent (it means the ‘healthy range of inflation’ to be 2– 6 per cent).
- RBI to publish the Operating Target and establish an Operating Procedure of monetary policy to achieve the target. Any change in the operating target and operating procedure in response to evolving macro-financial conditions shall also be published.
- Every six months, the RBI to publish a document explaining: (i) Source of inflation; (ii) Forecasts of inflation for the period between six to eighteen months from the date of the publication of the document; and
- The RBI shall be seen to have failed to meet the target if inflation is: (i) More than 6 per cent for three consecutive quarters for the financial year 2015– 16 and all subsequent years. (ii) Less than 2 per cent for three cons-ecutive quarters in 2016– 17 and all subsequent years.
- If the RBI fails to meet the target it shall set out in a report to the GoI: (i) the reasons for its failure to achieve the target under set in this agreement; (ii) remedial actions proposed to be taken by the RBI; and (iii) an estimate of the time-period within which the target would be achieved pursuant to timely implementation of proposed remedial actions.
- Any dispute regarding the interpretation or implementation of the agreement to be resolved between the Governor, RBI and the GoI.

This way India joined the club of inflation targeting countries such as USA, UK, European Union, Japan, South Korea, China, Indonesia and Brazil. It was New Zealand which went for inflation targeting in 1989 for the first time in the world.

#### Skewflation

Economists usually distinguish between inflation and a relative price increase. ‘Inflation’ refers to a sustained, across-the-board price increase, whereas ‘a relative price increase’ is a reference to an episodic price rise pertaining to one or a small group of commodities. This leaves a third phenomenon, namely one in which there is a price rise of one or a small group of commodities over a sustained period of time, without a traditional designation. ‘Skewflation’ is a relatively new term to describe this third category of price rise.

Skweflation in India
In India, food prices rose steadily during the last months of 2009 and the early months of 2010, even though the prices of non-food items continued to be relatively stable. As this somewhat unusual phenomenon stubbornly persisted, policymakers conferred on how to bring it to an end.

## GDP Deflator

This is the ratio of the GDP at current prices to that of the constant prices. It is derived by using the following formula—

GDP Deflator = GDP at Current Prices ÷ GDP at Constant Prices ¥ 100

- This shows the increase in the value of GDP due to increase in inflation in between the period— base year (i.e., the year of constant prices) and the current year.
- This is why it is used as a measure of inflation (also known as ‘implicit price deflator’).
- Though, countries use inflation indices to measure inflation, these inflation indices are not able to capture all goods and services produced by them.

- In case of India, while services are not included in the wholesale price index (WPI), the consumer price index (CPI) contains only those goods and services which households purchase for consumption (such as food, cloth, health, education, etc.) and misses several other goods and services (such as intermediate goods, services required by firms, etc.).
- Since the GDP deflator covers the entire range of goods and services produced in the economy, it is seen as a more comprehensive measure of inflation.

## Base Effect

- It refers to the impact of the rise in price level (i.e., last year’s inflation) in the previous year over the corresponding rise in price levels in the current year (i.e., current inflation).
- If the price index had risen at a high rate in the corresponding period of the previous year, leading to a high inflation rate, some of the potential rise is already factored in, therefore, a similar absolute increase in the Price index in the current year will lead to a relatively lower inflation rates.
- On the other hand, if the inflation rate was too low in the corresponding period of the previous year, even a relatively smaller rise in the Price Index will arithmetically give a high rate of current inflation.

### How the Federal Reserve Controls Inflation

#### The Way the Fed Uses Its Tools To Manage Prices

- The primary job of the RBI is to control inflation while avoiding a recession. It does this with **monetary policy**. To control inflation, the RBI must use **contractionary monetary policy** to slow economic growth.
- The Fed RBI slow this growth by **tightening the money supply**. That's the total amount of credit allowed into the market. The RBI's actions reduce the liquidity in the financial system, making it become more expensive to get loans. It slows economic growth and demand, which puts downward pressure on prices.

#### Tools the RBI Uses To Control Inflation

The RBI has several tools it traditionally uses to tame inflation. It usually uses

- open market operations (OMO),
- the federal funds rate, and
  -the discount rate in tandem.
- changes the reserve requirement

#### Open Market Operations (OMO)

- The RBI's first line of defense is OMO. The RBI buys or sells securities, typically Treasury notes, from its member banks.
- It buys securities when it wants them to have more money to lend.
- It sells these securities, which the banks are forced to buy.
- That reduces the RBI's capital, giving them less to lend.
- As a result, they can charge higher interest rates. That slows economic growth and mops up inflation.

#### Fed Funds Rate (FFR)

- The fed funds rate (FFR) is the most well-known of the Fed's tools.
- It's also part of its OMO.
- The FFR is the interest rate banks charge for overnight loans they make to each other.
- It has the same effect as changing the Reserve requirement and is easier for the Fed to modify.

#### Discount Rate

- The Fed also changes the discount rate.
- That's the interest rate the Fed charges to allow banks to borrow funds from the Fed's discount window.

#### Reserve Requirement

- The reserve requirement was the amount banks were required to keep in reserve at the end of each day.
- Increasing this reserve kept money out of circulation.
- Changing the fed funds rate has the same impact as adjusting the reserve requirement.

#### Managing Public Expectations

- Former RBI Chairman have noted that public expectations of inflation are an important influencer of the inflation rate.
- Once people anticipate future price increases, they create a self-fulfilling prophecy.
- They plan for future price increases by buying more now, thus driving up inflation even more.

::: warning Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
**How does raising interest rates curb inflation?**
Raising interest rates increases the costs of borrowing, and that reduces inflation by slowing the economy. When rates go up, fewer people take out loans for things like buying a home or starting a business. In theory, as demand slows for homes, employees, and other goods and services, prices will fall.

There are multi-dimensional effects of inflation on an economy both at the micro and macro levels. It redistributes income, distorts relative prices, destabilises employment, tax, saving and investment policies, and finally it may bring in recession and depression in an economy. A brief and objective overview of the effects of inflation is given below:

#### 1. On Creditors and Debtors

Inflation redistributes wealth from creditors to debtors, i.e., lenders suffer and borrowers benefit out of inflation. The opposite effect takes place when inflation falls (i.e., deflation).

#### 2. On Lending

With the rise in inflation, lending institutions feel the pressure of higher lending.

#### 3. On Aggregate Demand of the Economy

Rising inflation indicates rising aggregate demand and indicates comparatively lower supply and higher purchasing capacity among the consumers. Usually, higher inflation suggests the producers to increase their production level as it is generally considered as an indication of higher demand in the economy.

#### 4. On Investment

Investment in the economy is boosted by the inflation (in the short-run) because of two reasons: (i) Higher inflation indicates higher demand and suggests entrepreneurs to expand their production level, and (ii) Higher the inflation, lower the cost of loan

#### 5. On Income

Inflation affects the income of individual and firms alike. An increase in inflation, increases the ‘nominal’ value of income, while the ‘real’ value of income remains the same. Increased price levels erode the purchasing power of the money in the short-run, but in the long-run the income levels also increase (making the nominal value of income going upward). It means, in a given period of time income may go up due to two reasons, viz., inflationary situation and increased earning. The concept ‘GDP Deflator’ (GDP at current prices divided by GDP at constant prices) gives the idea of ‘inflation effect’ on income over a given period.

#### 6. On Saving

Holding money does not remain an intelligent economic decision (because money loses value with every increase in inflation) that is why people visit banks more frequently and try to hold least money with themselves and put maximum with the banks in their saving accounts (to minimise the loss in value of money with interest earned on it, provided bank is paying positive interest on saving account). This is also known as the shoe leather cost of inflation (as it consumes the precious time of the people visiting the bank frequently tagging their shoe). It means that saving rate increases. But this happens as a short-term effect of inflation. In the long-run, higher inflation depletes the saving rate in an economy. Just the opposite situation arises when inflation falls or shows falling traits with decreasing saving, in the short-run and increasing saving in the long-run, respectively.

#### 7. On Expenditure

Inflation affects both the forms of expenditures —consumption as well as investment. Increased prices make our consumption levels fall as goods and services we buy get costlier. We see a tendency among the people to cut their consumption levels aimed at neutralising the impact of price rise— making consumption expenditure fall. Exact opposite happens once prices head downward. On the other hand inflations makes ‘investment’ expenditure increase as a result of decreased cost of money/ finance (inflation brings benefit to borrower— known as ‘inflation premium’). In times of price fall just opposite happens.

#### 8. On Tax

On tax structure of the economy, inflation creates two distortions: (i) Tax-payers suffer while paying their direct and indirect taxes. As indirect taxes are imposed ad valorem (on value), increased prices of goods make tax-payers to pay increased indirect taxes (like cenvat, vat, etc., in India). Similarly, due to inflation, direct tax (income tax, interest tax, etc.) burden of the tax-payers also increases as tax-payer’s gross income moves to the upward slabs of official tax brackets (but the real value of money does not increase due to inflation; in fact, it falls). This problem is also known as bracket creep— i.e., inflation-induced tax increases. 39 Some economies (as in the US and many European countries) have indexed their tax provisions to neutralise this distortion on the direct tax payers.

(ii) The extent to which tax collections of the government are concerned, inflation increases the nominal value of the gross tax revenue, while real value of the tax collection does not compare with the current pace of inflation as there is a lag (delay) in the tax collection in all economies. But governments get an advantage on their interest burden, on their borrowings as inflation benefits borrowers. This benefit, however, depends upon the contemporary levels of fiscal deficit and the total national debt. In the case of a government incurring high fiscal deficit (increased borrowing, printing currency), inflation functions as a tax, i.e., inflation tax via which the government fulfils its expenditure by cutting down the expenditure and consumption of the people.

#### 9. On Exchange Rate

With every inflation the currency of the economy depreciates (loses its exchange value in front of a foreign currency) provided it follows the flexible currency regime. Though it is a comparative matter, there might be inflationary pressure on the foreign currency against which the exchange rate is compared.

#### 10. On Export

With inflation, exportable items of an economy gain competitive prices in the world market. Due to this, the volume of export increases (keep in mind that the value of export decreases here) and thus export income increases in the economy. It means export segment of the economy benefits due to inflation. Importing partners of the economy exert pressure for a stable exchange rate as their imports start increasing and exports start decreasing (see the next point).

#### 11. On Import

Inflation gives an economy the advantage of lower imports and import-substitution as foreign goods become costlier. But in the case of compulsory imports (i.e., oil, technology, drugs, etc.) the economy does not get this benefit and loses more foreign currency instead of saving it.

#### 12. On Trade Balance

In the case of a developed economy, inflation makes trade balance favourable, while for the developing economies inflation is unfavourable for their balance of trade. This is because of composition of their foreign trade. The benefit to export which inflation brings in to a developing economy is usually lower than the loss it incur due to its compulsory imports which become costlier due to inflation.

#### 13. On Employment

Inflation increases employment in the short-run, but becomes neutral or even negative in the long run.

#### 14. On Wages

Inflation increases the nominal (face) value of wages, while their real value falls. That is why there is a negative impact of inflation on the purchasing power and living standard of wage employees. To neutralise this negative impact the Indian government provides dearness allowance to its employees twice a year.

#### 15. On the Self-employed

Inflation has a neutralising impact on the self-employed people in the long-run. But in the short-run they also get affected as the economy as a whole gets affected.

#### 16. On the Economy

All the segments discussed above belong to an economy, but we must know the overall short-term and long-term impacts of inflation on an economy. Experiences of the world economies in the late 1980s show that a particular level of inflation is healthy for an economy. This specific level of inflation was called as the ‘range’ of inflation and every economy needs to calculate its own range. Inflation beyond both the limits of the range is never healthy for any economy. In the case of India, it is considered 2 to 6 per cent at CPI( C), which is also known as the ‘comfort zone’ of inflation in India since 2015. Similarly for Australia, New Zealand, the USA, Canada and the European Union, the healthy range today is 1 to 3 per cent. This is why every economy today utilises inflation targeting as part of its monetary policy. Inflation beyond the limits of the decided/ prescribed range brings in recession to depression.
