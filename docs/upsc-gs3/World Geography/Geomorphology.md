# Geomorphology

## Interior Structure of the Earth

Like all terrestrial planets, the Earth’s interior is differentiated. This means that its internal structure consists of layers, arranged like the skin of an onion. Peel back one, and you find another, distinguished from the last by its chemical and geological properties, as well as vast differences in temperature and pressure.

### Layers of the Earth

The Earth can be divided into one of two ways – mechanically or chemically. Mechanically – or rheologically, meaning the study of liquid states – it can be divided into the lithosphere, asthenosphere, mesospheric mantle, outer core, and the inner core. But chemically or by composition, which is the more popular of the two, it can be divided into the crust, the mantle (which can be subdivided into the upper and lower mantle), and the core – which can also be subdivided into the outer core, and inner core.

**Compositional layers of the Earth:**

Core, mantle, and crust are divisions based on composition. The crust makes up less than 1 percent of Earth by mass, consisting of oceanic crust and continental crust is often more felsic rock. The mantle is hot and represents about 68 percent of Earth’s mass. Finally, the core is mostly iron metal. The core makes up about 31% of the Earth.

![Compositional Layers of Earth](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compositional-Layers-of-Earth.png)

---

**Crust:**

- It is the **outermost solid part of the earth**, normally about **8-40 kms thick.**
- It is brittle in nature.
- Nearly **1% of the earth’s volume** and **5% of earth’s mass** are made of the crust.
- The thickness of the crust under the oceanic and continental areas are different. **Oceanic crust is thinner** (about 5kms) as compared to the continental crust (about 30kms).
- **Major constituent elements** of crust are Silica (Si) and Aluminium (Al) and thus, it is often termed as **SIAL**(Sometimes SIAL is used to refer Lithosphere, which is the region comprising the crust and uppermost solid mantle, also).
- The mean density of the materials in the crust is 3g/cm3.
- The discontinuity between the **hydrosphere and crust**is termed as the **Conrad Discontinuity.**

---

**Mantle:**

- The portion of the interior beyond the crust is called as the mantle.
- The discontinuity between the **crust and mantle**is called as the **Mohorovich Discontinuity or Moho discontinuity.**
- The mantle is about 2900kms in thickness.
- **Nearly 84% of the earth’s volume** and 67% of the earth’s mass is occupied by the mantle.
- The major constituent elements of the mantle are Silicon and Magnesium and hence it is also termed as **SIMA**.
- The density of the layer is higher than the crust and varies from 3.3 – 5.4g/cm3.
- The uppermost solid part of the mantle and the entire crust constitute the **Lithosphere**.
- The **asthenosphere** (in between 80-200km) is a highly viscous, mechanically weak and ductile,  deforming region of the upper mantle which lies just below the lithosphere.
- The asthenosphere is the main source of magma and it is the layer over which the lithospheric plates/ continental plates move (plate tectonics).
- The discontinuity between the **upper mantle and the lower mantle**is known as **Repetti Discontinuity**.
- The portion of the mantle which is just below the lithosphere and asthenosphere, but above the core is called as **Mesosphere**.

---

**Core:**

- - It is the innermost layer surrounding the earth’s centre.
  - The **core is separated from the mantle by Guttenberg’s Discontinuity**.
  - It is composed mainly of iron (Fe) and nickel (Ni) and hence it is also called as **NIFE**.
  - The core constitutes nearly 15% of earth’s volume and 32.5% of earth’s mass.
  - The core is the densest layer of the earth with its density ranges between 9.5-14.5g/cm3.
  - The Core consists of two sub-layers: the inner core and the outer core.
  - The inner core is in solid state and the outer core is in the liquid state (or semi-liquid).
  - The discontinuity between the upper core and the lower core is called as **Lehmann Discontinuity.**
  - **Barysphere** is sometimes used to refer the core of the earth or sometimes the whole interior.

**Mechanical Layers of the Earth:**

The structure of the Earth can also be defined and divided based on how the insides of the planet behavior. Thereby, the mechanical layers correspond to the physical or mechanical properties of these layers.

Below are brief overviews of the five mechanical layers of the Earth:

![Mechanical Layers of Earth](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mechanical-Layers-of-Earth.png)

---

**Lithosphere:**

- - The lithosphere is the **outermost layer** of the Earth that consists of the entire crust and the top-most portion of the mantle.
  - The **average thickness is ~70km,** but ranges widely: It can be very thin, only a few km thick under oceanic crust or mid-ocean ridges, or very thick, 150+ km under continental crust, particularly mountain belts.
  - Depth- 0-100 km
  - Furthermore, they are divided into pieces called **tectonic plates.**
  - The movements of these plates are responsible for mountain-building, oceanic trench formation, earthquakes, and volcanic eruption.

---

**Asthenosphere:**

- - The asthenosphere includes the soft layer of the mantle on which the lithosphere moves.
  - Depth- **100km to 350 km** **.**
  - It is made of **solid silicate materials**, but the high temperature allows it to flow on very long timescales.
  - The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is where geophysicists mark the difference in ductility between the two layers.

---

**Mesosphere:**

- - The mesosphere is the layer below the asthenosphere but above the outer core. It is essentially the lower mantle.
  - Average depth-350-2900km
  - Despite its high temperature, the intense pressure in this region restricts the movements of the molecules of the silicate material despite being under high temperature, thus making it **extremely rigid**.

---

**Outer Core:**

- - The outer core extends from the bottom of the mesosphere or the lower mantle and surrounds the inner core.
  - Composed of **iron and nickel,** the extreme temperature allows these metals to remain in their liquid phases.
  - It is the only layer of the Earth that is **a true liquid**.
  - Furthermore, its movement is responsible for generating the **magnetic field.**

---

**Inner Core:**

- - The inner core is also made of **iron and some nickel.**
  - However, unlike the outer core, it is a **solid ball.**
  - The solidity is due to the intense pressure from the upper layers.
  - Hence, although it is as hot as the surface of the Sun, there is speculation that the inner core is slowly growing as the liquid outer core at the boundary with the inner core cools and solidifies due to the gradual interior cooling.

### Temperature, Pressure and Density of the Earth’s Interior

**Temperature**

- A rise in temperature with increase in depth is observed in mines and deep wells.
- These evidence along with molten lava erupted from the earth’s interior supports that the temperature increases towards the centre of the earth.
- The different observations show that the rate of increase of temperature is not uniform from the surface towards the earth’s centre. It is faster at some places and slower at other places.
- In the beginning, this rate of increase of temperature is at an average rate of 1C for every 32m increase in depth.
- While in the upper 100kms, the increase in temperature is at the rate of 12C per km and in the next 300kms, it is 20C per km. But going further deep, this rate reduces to mere 10C per km.
- Thus, it is assumed that the **rate of increase of temperature beneath the surface is decreasing\*\***towards the centre** (do not confuse rate of increase of temperature with increase of temperature. **Temperature is always increasing from the earth’s surface towards the centre\*\*).
- The temperature at the centre is estimated to lie somewhere between 3000C and 5000C, may be that much higher due to the chemical reactions under high-pressure conditions.
- Even in such a high temperature also, the materials at the centre of the earth are in solid state because of the heavy pressure of the overlying materials.

---

**Pressure**

- Just like the temperature, the **pressure is also increasing from the surface towards the centre**of the earth.
- It is due to the huge weight of the overlying materials like rocks.
- It is estimated that in the deeper portions, the pressure is tremendously high which will be nearly 3 to 4 million times more than the pressure of the atmosphere at sea level.
- At high temperature, the materials beneath will melt towards the centre part of the earth but due to heavy pressure, these molten materials acquire the properties of a solid and are probably in a plastic state.

---

**Density**

- Due to increase in pressure and presence of heavier materials like Nickel and Iron towards the centre, the **density of earth’s layers also gets on increasing towards the centre**.
- The average density of the layers gets on increasing from crust to core and it is nearly 14.5g/cm3 at the very centre.

### Sources of information for the study of Earth’s Interior

**Direct Sources of information about the Earth’s Interior**

1.  Deep earth mining and drilling reveal the nature of rocks deep down the surface.
2.  But as mining and drilling are not practically possible beyond a certain depth, they don’t reveal much information about the earth’s interior.
3.  **Mponeng gold mine**(deepest mine in the world) and **TauTona gold mine**(second deepest mine in the world) in South Africa are deepest mines reaching to a depth of only 3.9 km.
4.  And the deepest drilling is only about 12 km deep hole bored by the Soviet Union in the 1970s over the **Kola Peninsula**.
5.  Volcanic eruption forms another source of obtaining direct information.

---

**Indirect Sources of information about the Earth’s Interior:**

1.  By analysing the **rate of change of temperature and pressure**from the surface towards the interior.
2.  **Meteors**, as they belong to the same type of materials earth is made of.
3.  **Gravitation**, which is greater near poles and less at the equator.
4.  **Gravity anomaly**, which is the change in gravity value according to the mass of material, gives us information about the materials in the earth’s interior.
5.  **Magnetic sources**. Magnetic surveys also provide information about the distribution of magnetic materials in the crustal portion, and thus, provide information about the distribution of materials in this part.
6.  **Seismic Waves**: the shadow zones of body waves (Primary and secondary waves) give us information about the state of materials in the interior.

### Relevance of Seismology in studying the interior of the Earth

**Seismic waves** are the waves of energy that travel through the Earth as a result of an earthquake and can tell a lot about the internal structure of the Earth **because these waves travel at different speeds in different materials.**

![Relevance of Seismology in studying the interior of the Earth](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Relevance-of-Seismology-in-studying-the-interior-of-the-Earth.png)

There are two types of waves that travel through the Earth:**p-waves and s-waves**.

1.  **P- waves are faster and they can travel through both solids and liquids.**
2.  **S-waves are slower and cannot travel through liquids.**For both kinds of waves, the speed at which the wave travels also depends on the properties of the material through which it is traveling.

Thus, if there is an earthquake somewhere, the first waves that arrive are P-waves.  In essence, the gap in P-wave and S-wave arrival gives a first estimate of the distance to the earthquake.

![P & S Waves](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/P-S-Waves.png)

**Relevance:**

- Scientists are able to learn about Earth’s internal structure **by measuring the arrival of seismic waves at stations around the world**. For example, **they know that Earth’s outer core is liquid because s-waves are not able to pass through it**.
- Seismic waves travel in **curved paths** through the Earth (because of the increasing pressure, materials are more dense towards the core, travel velocity of seismic waves increases).
- **Refraction of seismic waves** causes them to curve away from a direct path.
- **Reflection** causes them to glance off certain surfaces (e.g. core mantle boundary) when they hit it at too shallow of an angle.
- The result of this behavior, in combination with the fact **that S-waves cannot travel through liquids is the appearance of seismic shadows, opposite of the actual earthquake site.**
- When an earthquake occurs there is a “**shadow zone”** on the opposite side of the earth where no s-waves arrive.
- Similarly earth has a **solid inner core because some p-waves are reflected off the boundary between the inner core and the outer core.**
- **By measuring the time it takes for seismic waves to travel along many different paths through the earth, they figure out the velocity structure of the earth**. Abrupt changes in velocity with depth correspond to boundaries between different layers of the Earth composed of different materials.

### Importance of studying interior of the earth

- We rely on Earth for valuable resources such as soil, water, metals, industrial minerals, and energy, and we need to know how to find these resources and exploit them sustainably.
- We can study rocks and the fossils they contain to understand the evolution of our environment and the life within it.
- We can learn to minimize our risks from earthquakes, volcanoes, slope failures, and damaging storms.
- We can learn how and why Earth’s climate has changed in the past, and use that knowledge to understand both natural and human-caused climate change.
- We can recognize how our activities have altered the environment in many ways and the climate in increasingly serious ways, and how to avoid more severe changes in the future.
- We can use our knowledge of Earth to understand other planets in our solar system, as well as those around distant stars.

## Rocks

### Minerals

Our Earth is made mostly of rocks. The rocks are composed of mineral grains combined in different ways and having various properties.

- **Minerals** are naturally occurring chemical compounds in which atoms are arranged in three-dimensional patterns.
- The kind of elements and their arrangements lead to a particular appearance and certain properties for each mineral.
- The same chemical elements when arranged in different patterns show different characteristics.
- Classic examples are minerals made of the element carbon (C). Flat planes of carbon atoms form the mineral graphite, which is a gray, slippery, soft material. Carbon atoms arranged in a different pattern form the mineral diamond — the hardest natural substance known. Although they have the same chemical composition, their different internal crystal structures form very different materials.
- A mineral is composed of **two or more elements**. But, sometimes single element minerals like sulphur, copper, silver, gold, graphite, etc are also found.
- The basic source of all minerals is the hot magma in the interior of the earth.
- When magma cools, crystals of the minerals appear and a systematic series of minerals are formed in sequence to solidify so as to form rocks.
- The minerals which contain metals are called as **metallic minerals (eg: Haematite**) and the metallic minerals which are profitably mined are called as the ores.
- The **crust of the earth is made up of more than 2000 minerals**, but out of these, only six are the most abundant and contribute the maximum.
- **These six most abundant minerals are feldspar, quartz, pyroxenes, amphiboles, mica and olivine.**

---

**Some Major Minerals:**

**Quartz:**

- It is one of the most important components of sand and granite.
- It consists of silica and it is a hard mineral virtually insoluble in water.
- It is usually white or colourless.
- They are used in the manufacturing of radio, radar, etc.

**Feldspar:**

- Silicon and oxygen are major elements of all types of feldspar.
- Sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminium, etc are found in specific feldspar varieties.
- **Half of the earth’s crust is composed of feldspar (plagioclase (39%) and alkali feldspar (12%))**.
- It has light cream to salmon pink colour.
- It is commonly used in ceramics and glass making.

**Pyroxene:**

- The common elements in pyroxene are Calcium, aluminium, magnesium, iron and silicon.
- About 10% of the earth’s crust is made up of pyroxene.
- It is commonly found in meteorites.
- Its colour is usually green or black.

**Amphibole:**

- Aluminium, calcium, silicon, iron and magnesium are the major elements of amphiboles.
- **They form 7% of the earth’s crust**.
- It is green or black in colour and is used in asbestos industries commonly.
- Hornblende is another form of amphiboles.

**Mica:**

- It is made up of elements like potassium, aluminium, magnesium, iron, silicon, etc.
- It forms 4% of the earth’s crust.
- It is commonly found in igneous and metamorphic rocks.
- Mica is widely used in electronic instruments.

### Formation of Rocks

**Rocks are aggregates of minerals**. A mineral is an inorganic, crystalline solid. This means that it has a regular, repeating series of molecules that ultimately determine its form. Quartz is an example of a very common mineral. Another is halite, commonly known as table salt. You can have very large quantities of a particular mineral, and even very large single crystals of minerals. Once you have more than one mineral together though, you’ve got a rock.

It is in the lithosphere that rocks are formed and reformed. And depending on the type of rock, the process through which they are created varies. In all, there are three types of rocks: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Each type of rock has a different origin.

---

**How Are Igneous Rocks Formed?**

Igneous rocks are formed when melted rock cools and solidifies. Melted rock may come in the form of magma, when it is found underneath the Earth’s surface. It can also come in the form of lava, when it is released unto the Earth’s surface during a volcanic eruption.

- - **Some examples of igneous rocks are granite, scoria, pumice, and obsidian.**Pumice, for instance, is formed when lava made up of melted rock, water, and trapped gas is ejected from a volcano during a violent eruption. As the ejected material undergoes very rapid cooling and depressurization, some of the trapped gas escape, leaving holes and gas bubbles on the solidified material.

---

**How Are Sedimentary Rocks Formed?**

Sedimentary rocks start forming when soil and other materials on the Earth’s surface are eroded and finally settle down, forming one layer of sediments. As time passes, more and more materials get eroded and settle on the older layers. Thus, layer upon layer is formed. The lower layers undergo intense pressure due to the weight of the upper layers, eventually evolving into rocks.

- - **Some examples of sedimentary rocks are sandstone, limestone, shale, conglomerate, and gypsum.** Sandstone, for instance, is a result of depositions of sand from beaches and rivers. One can find them mostly in deltas, since this is where the rivers flow into the ocean.

---

**How Are Metamorphic Rocks Formed?**

To metamorphose or simply to morph means ‘to change in form’. Metamorphic rocks are actually products of rocks that have undergone changes. Thus, a metamorphic rock may have originally been an igneous, sedimentary, or even another metamorphic rock. The changes occur when the original rocks are subjected to extreme heat and pressure beneath the Earth’s surface.They may also occur when the the original rocks are caught in the middle of two colliding tectonic boundaries.

- - **Some examples of metamorphic rocks are marble, slate, schist and gneiss.** Marble, for instance is the result of the metamorphism of limestone and dolostone. When limestone metamorphoses, its calcite grains grow and interlock with one another. As such, marble is denser and harder compared to limestone.

### Different types of Rocks

There are three broad categories of rocks. They are Igneous, Sedimentary, and Metamorphic.

![Classification of Rocks](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Classification-of-Rocks.png)

![Classification of Rocks](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Classification-of-Rocks.png?resize=525%2C305&ssl=1)

**Igneous Rocks**

- Igneous rocks start as molten material that cools and solidifies.
- Granite, for instance was once a super heated liquid. When this liquid is beneath the surface of the earth, it’s called **magma**. Once it reaches the surface, perhaps as an eruption, it is called **lava**.
- Lava cools very quickly, since the temperature of the surface (let’s say 32 degrees Fahrenheit, or zero degrees Celsius) is significantly cooler than the lava, which can be more than 1000 degrees F. This rapid cooling is called **quenching**, and is how glass-like rocks, like obsidian, form.
- Bringing material as hot as lava to the surface is somewhat like sticking a red-hot iron into a pot of water. Igneous rocks can (and often do) cool beneath the surface of the earth, the molten material moving up from the mantle but never making it to the surface. Other times they **extrude** at the surface, either at **mid-oceanic ridges** or **hotspots**.

---

**Sedimentary Rocks**

- **Sedimentary**rocks are made up of grains that break off of other rocks through a process called weathering.
- When rocks are exposed to rain, wind, temperature changes, roots, and some chemicals, they can be broken down into their basic components.
- **Physical weathering**breaks off grains of rock, while **chemical weathering** breaks rocks down into more basic elemental components.
- These grains can come from other sedimentary rocks, from igneous rocks, or from metamorphic rocks.
- Grains are transported downstream, eventually settling in a basin, or low energy environment (for example a lake or an ocean).
- Over time, as more sediment is deposited, layers of sediment are buried deep enough to be **lithified**, or turned to stone.
- Because features of the environment are preserved in the sediments, one can tell something about where the rock was deposited.
- For example, a rock with leaf fossils preserved must have been formed in a slow, stagnant environment – one in which the leaves would not be disturbed or moved away.
- Sedimentary rocks are all about what remains.
- **Black shales, organic rich sediments from which we extract oil and gas,** form in deep marine settings, where there is very little energy and there is very little oxygen to decompose the organic material that gets deposited.

---

**Metamorphic Rocks**

- **Metamorphic**rocks are rocks that have been deformed.
- They have been heated or squashed or buried (which often means they are both heated and squashed), which can cause minerals in the rocks to recrystallize.
- Metamorphic rocks form in places where change is happening: they can form in mountain belts (**collision zones**) where rock is compressed or buried, along fault planes, along **subduction zones**, next to magma pockets as the neighboring rock is cooked, to name a few.
- Marble is metamorphosed limestone (a chemical sedimentary rock). Slate was once used as the backing of chalkboards.
- Any type of rock can be metamorphosed, including metamorphic rocks.

### Rock cycle

Each of the rock types is related to the others through different physical and chemical processes.
Mountains can expose igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks to weathering and erosion.
Grains of sediment (or boulders!) break off of these exposed rocks, and, due to gravity, move downhill either in a stream bed or by rolling. This travel causes further breakdown of the sediment, which eventually reaches the ocean. The sediment, once deposited in an ocean basin, gets buried by other sediment, and compacted into a sedimentary rock. If it’s buried deep enough, or if the basin becomes part of an orogen, it can be metamorphosed, becoming a metamorphic rock.
Eventually, the rock can either become exposed through sea level fall or mountain-building, where it starts the journey back to the ocean again, or it can be recycled back into the mantle at a subduction zone, perhaps one day returning to the surface as an igneous rock.
The following concept map shows the rock cycle in terms of earth processes. New material comes from mid-ocean ridges and volcanoes; it is weathered, deformed, compacted and cemented, until it is recycled back into the mantle at a subduction zone.
rock cycle

### Rock to Soil formation

- The early phase of **soil formation starts by disintegrating the rock under the influence of climate.  
  **
  - - **Rainwater will dissolve rock elements**, **temperature fluctuations** will cause cracks and fissures in the rocks.
    - **Freezing and thawing of water** captured in the rock will widen existing cracks and cavities.
    - **Pioneer vegetation**, at first lichens, will settle and their roots will further loosen the rock.
    - Moreover, **decaying plant debris** will produce organic acids, which further disintegrates the rock.
    - **Organic matter** will start to accumulate and be mixed with the mineral material provided by the rock.
- Over time, rock minerals will be dissolved or transformed.
- Elements released from the rock will precipitate and new minerals may be formed. **For example, iron will be oxidized and precipitate as iron oxides or hydroxides, giving the soil reddish or yellowish-brownish colours.**
- Soil fauna will settle and mix (‘homogenize’) the soil. The soil will grow in depth through newly formed soil material at the bottom.
- **The soil matures.**
- Given sufficient time under stable environmental conditions, soils will reach a steady state, whereby soil build-up matches their breakdown.
- Production of humus from decaying vegetation debris will equal its consumption by soil microbae, fauna and flora.
- Transformation of rock minerals into soil minerals will keep pace with the removal of earlier formed soil minerals.
- Slow surface wash of topsoil is matched by new formation of soil material from the bedrock.
- **The soil has aged.**

## Landform Development

A landform is a feature on the Earth’s surface that is part of the terrain.

Mountains, hills, plateaus, and plains are the four major types of landforms. Minor landforms include buttes, canyons, valleys, and basins.

Tectonic plate movement under the Earth can create landforms by pushing up mountains and hills. Erosion by water and wind can wear down land and create landforms like valleys and canyons. Both processes happen over a long period of time, sometimes millions of years.

[![landforms](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/landforms.gif?resize=525%2C645&ssl=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/landforms.gif)

---

**Classification of landforms:**

In terms of origin, oceans and continents have certain differences. Generally, the materials which constitute the ocean bottom are harder and heavier than those which constitute the continents. Though the interior of the earth is still in a hot and molten state, it is still undergoing contraction.

The contractions could be slow or sudden. Whether slow or sudden, the contractions are continuously altering the form of the earth’s surface. Such changes on the earth’s surface are therefore caused by the actions of internal force.

Since the very beginning of the earth, its surface has been continuously subjected to change by the action of river, glaciers, winds, sea waves, earthquakes, etc. Such changes are, therefore, caused by the actions of external force.

---

**Based on the order of relief development landforms can be classified into:**

**First order, second order and third order landforms**

- **Landforms of First Order:** By the actions of internal forces anticlines and synclines were formed and in course of time these have been identified as continents and oceans. That is why, they are called **as Landforms of First Order** or Primary landforms.

The continental landforms consist of Americas, Eurasia, Africa, Australia and Antarctica. The total area is nearly 148 million sq km, i.e., 28 per cent of the earth’s surface and average height is 830 metres.

- **Landforms of Second Order:**

The plateaus, mountains, plains and extensive deserts of the continents are the example of the landforms of second order on the continents.

- **Landform of Third Order:**

Various features which are generally smaller parts of second order landforms or which form on the second order landforms are known as landforms of third order. There are innumerable such landforms over the continents and at the sea floor.

Peaks, cols, cirques, gorge, morains, alluvial fans, floodplains, ox-bow lakes, levees, deltas, ocean islands, volcanoes and ridges are some of the many features of third order landforms.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/classification-of-landforms.jpg)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/classification-of-landforms.jpg)

---

**The landforms that are found on the surface of the Earth can also be grouped into 4 of the following categories:**

**(a) Structural Landforms** – landforms that are created by the solidification of large quantities of magma or by massive movements due or rock because of plate tectonics. This includes landforms like: shield, fold mountains, rift valleys, and volcanoes.

**(b) Weathering Landforms** – landforms that are created by the physical, chemical or biological decomposition of rock through weathering. Weathering produces landforms where rocks and sediments are decomposed and disintegrated. This includes landforms with some of the following geomorphic features: karst, patterned ground, and soil profiles.

**(c) Erosional Landforms** – landforms formed from the removal of  weathered  and  eroded  surface materials by wind, water, glaciers, and gravity. This includes landforms with some of the following geomorphic features: river valleys, glacial valleys, and coastal cliffs.

**(d) Depositional Landforms** – landforms formed from the  deposition  of  weathered  and  eroded surface materials. On occasion, these deposits can be compressed, altered by pressure, heat and chemical processes to become sedimentary rocks. This includes landforms with some of the following geomorphic features: beaches, deltas, flood plains, and glacial moraines.

Many landforms show the influence of several of the above processes. These **landforms are called polygenetic**. Processes acting on landforms can also change over time, and a single landscape can undergo several cycles of development. This type of landscape development is **called polycyclic**.

## First order relief (Theories)

Relief is simply the difference in elevation between higher point and lower point on the earth’s surface. The highest point of the earth is the peak of the Mount Everest and the lower point is Mariana trench in Pacific Ocean. The difference in elevation of the earth’s surface is due to endogenic and exogenic process operating in the earth’s crust. Relief is arranged in order according to time, process and the ways are formed (shaping or reshaping).

**First order relief** would be global scale contrasts between continents and ocean basins, between, say, Africa and the Indian  Ocean or North America and the Pacific Basin.

**First order relief features are tectonic plates** and are the largest in special extent. There are two types of plates; continental plates and Oceanic plates. These are differentiated by their rock and mineral composition. Continental plates are lighter in density and are composed of granitic rock materials rich in silica and aluminum. The oceanic plates are made up of dense, basaltic rock composed of silica and magnesium.

The formation of First order reliefs can be explained by the following theories:

- Continental Drift Theory
- Sea Floor Spreading
- Plate Tectonics Theory

### Continental Drift Theory

Continental Drift Theory was put forward by the **German scientist Alfred Wegner in 1915.**

According to the Continental Drift Theory, part of the crust are capable of horizontal movement round the globe causing the continents to slowly change their positions in relation to one another.

The fact that South America is a mirror image of Africa is presented as a proof of the continental drift theory (see video below for an animation showing the migration of both of these continents).

For hundreds of millions of years, all the land of Earth was joined together in one large mass or super continent. Scientists call it **Pangaea** (meaning “all lands” in Greek). Then about 200 million years ago the land began to drift apart. It broke into two pieces, and scientists have called the continent in the north **Laurasia** and the continent in the south **Gondwanaland**  (named by Eduard Suess, an Austrian geologist).The two large continents continued to break apart into the smaller continents that exist today. Scientists call this movement **‘continental drift’.**

**Forces responsible for drifting of continents (According to Alfred Wegner)**

According to Wegener, the drift was in two directions:

1.  **Towards the equator** due to the interaction of **forces of gravity, pole-fleeing force** (due to centrifugal force caused by earth’s rotation) and **buoyancy** (_ship floats in water due to buoyant force offered by water_)
2.  **Westwards** due to **tidal currents** because of the earth’s motion (earth rotates from west to east, so tidal currents act from east to west, according to Wegener).

- Wegener suggested that **tidal force** (gravitational pull of the moon and to a lesser extent, the sun) also played a major role.
- **The polar-fleeing force** relates to the rotation of the earth. Earth is not a perfect sphere; it has a bulge at the equator. This bulge is due to the rotation of the earth (greater centrifugal force at the equator).
- **Centrifugal force** increases as we move from poles towards the equator. This increase in centrifugal force has led to pole fleeing, according to Wegener.
- Tidal force is due to the attraction of the moon and the sun that develops tides in oceanic waters (tides explained in detail in oceanography).
- According to Wegener, these forces would become effective when applied over many million years, and the drift is continuing.

**The [evidences](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/12/09/secure-synopsis-9-december-2020/) in support of the continental drift theory:**

**Jigsaw Fit:**

The similarity in outline of the coastlines of eastern South America and West Africa had been noted for some time. The best fit is obtained if the coastlines are matched at a depth of 1,000 meters below current sea level

![Jigsaw fit](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jigsaw-fit.png?fit=375%2C440&ssl=1)

**Geological Fit:**

When the geology of eastern South America and West Africa was mapped it revealed that ancient rock outcrops (cratons) over 2,000 million years old were continuous from one continent to the other.

**Tectonic Fit:**

- - Fragments of an old fold mountain belt between 450 and 400 million years ago are found on widely separated continents today.
  - Pieces of the Caledonian fold mountain belt are found in Greenland, Canada, Ireland, England, Scotland and Scandinavia. When these land masses are re-assembled the mountain, belt forms a continuous linear feature.

![tectonic fit](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tectonic-fit.png?fit=525%2C315&ssl=1)

**Glacial Deposits:**

- - Today, glacial deposits formed during the Permo-Carboniferous glaciation (about 300 million years ago) are found in Antarctica, Africa, South America, India and Australia.
  - If the continents haven’t moved, then this would suggest an ice sheet extended from the South Pole to the equator at this time – which is unlikely as the UK at this time was also close to the equator and has extensive coal and limestone deposits.
  - If the continents of the southern hemisphere are re-assembled near the South Pole, then the Permo-Carboniferous ice sheet assumes a much more reasonable size

![Glacial Deposits](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Glacial-Deposits.png?fit=525%2C400&ssl=1)

**Fossil Evidence:**

- - There are many examples of fossils found on separate continents and nowhere else, suggesting the continents were once joined. If Continental Drift had not occurred, the alternative explanations would be:
  - The species evolved independently on separate continents – contradicting Darwin’s theory of evolution.
  - They swam to the other continent/s in breeding pairs to establish a second population.

![Fossil evidence](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fossil-evidence.png?fit=525%2C356&ssl=1)

**[Criticism](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/12/09/secure-synopsis-9-december-2020/) faced by Continental Drift Theory:**

- Wegener failed to explain why the drift began only in Mesozoic era and not before.
- The theory doesn’t consider oceans.
- Proofs heavily depend on assumptions that are generalist.
- Forces like buoyancy, tidal currents and gravity are too weak to be able to move continents.
- Modern theories (Plate Tectonics) accept the existence of Pangaea and related landmasses but give a very different explanation to the causes of drift

### Sea Floor Spreading

A map of the ocean floor shows a variety of topographic features: flat plains, long mountain chains, and deep trenches. **Mid-ocean ridges** are part of chain of mountains some 84,000 km long. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is the longest mountain chain on Earth. These ridges are spreading centers or **divergent plate boundaries** where the upwelling of magma from the mantle creates new ocean floor.

**Deep-sea trenches** are long, narrow basins which extend 8-11 km below sea level. Trenches develop adjacent to subduction zones, where oceanic lithosphere slides back into the mantle.

![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Sea-floor-spreading.jpg)

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Sea-floor-spreading.jpg?resize=359%2C245&ssl=1)

**Hypothesis**

**Sea-floor spreading** — In the early 1960s, Princeton geologist Harry Hess proposed the hypothesis of sea-floor spreading, in which basaltic magma from the mantle rises to create new ocean floor at mid-ocean ridges. On each side of the ridge, sea floor moves from the ridge towards the deep-sea trenches, where it is subducted and recycled back into the mantle.

A test of the hypothesis of sea-floor spreading was provided by studies of the Earth’s magnetism.

**Evidences**

**Age of the sea floor:**

- - - The age of the sea-floor also supports sea-floor spreading.
    - If sea-floor spreading operates, the youngest oceanic crust should be found at the ridges and progressively older crust should be found in moving away from the ridges towards the continents. This is the case.
    - The oldest known ocean floor is dated at about 200 million years, indicating that older ocean floor has been destroyed through subduction at deep-sea trenches.

**Magnetic anomalies:**

![Magnetic anomalies](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Magnetic-anomalies.jpg)

![Magnetic anomalies](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Magnetic-anomalies.jpg?resize=525%2C394&ssl=1)

- - - Magnetic surveys over the ocean floor in the 1960s revealed symmetrical patterns of **magnetic “bands,” (zebra stripes)**anomalies parallel to midoceanic rifts .
    - The same patterns in relation to midoceanic rifts are present in different oceans.
    - The magnetic anomalies coincide with the episodes of magnetic reversals that have been documented from studies on land, indicating that the andesitic rocks that form new oceanic crust in the tensional setting of the rift valley record the earth’s magnetic field as they cool.
    - A rock has a **normal (positive) polarity** when its paleomagnetic field is the same as the earth’s field today.
    - The positive magnetism adds to the earth’s magnetic field and creates a higher magnetic measurement at that location.
    - Rocks are **negatively polarized**when the earth’s field is reversed, which reduces the earth’s net field strength.
    - Since the ages of these anomalies are known from dating the **paleomagnetic reversals on land, the rate of movement of the ocean floor can be calculated.**
    - The fact that new ocean crust moves away from the midoceanic ridge at speeds that range from 2 to 10 centimeters per year has also been documented using satellite measurements and radar. **For example, if it is known that a segment of sea floor that formed 10.0 million years ago is now 50 kilometers (5.0 million cm) away from the crest of the ridge, it can be calculated that it traveled that distance at about 2 centimeters per year.**
    - By using the calculated ages for episodes of paleomagnetic reversal, scientists can construct sea floor age maps, which confirm that the youngest oceanic crust is presently being formed at midoceanic ridges and that the oldest is about 150 to 200 million years old, or late Jurassic in age.
    - This older material is the farthest from the spreading centers and is the next crust to be subducted.
    - Sea floor age maps have been proven correct by the age dates calculated from hundreds of rock samples gathered from the ocean floor.

**Seismic studies:**

- - - More proof for sea floor spreading comes from seismic studies indicating that earthquakes occur along the rift valley of a midoceanic ridge and the cross‐cutting fractures that offset it.
    - Rift valley earthquakes occur only along transform faults, those portions of the fracture zone located between the offset sections of a ridge and rift valley.
    - Because of the way in which the sea floor spreads (that is, away from both sides of a midoceanic ridge), transform faults are the only areas along the fracture zone in which sections of the oceanic crust pass one another in opposite directions.
    - The concentration of earthquakes in the transform‐fault sections of the fracture zones further supports the concept of ocean crust moving away from a midoceanic ridge.

**Modern plate tectonic theory:**

- - - By the 1960s, the theories of continental drift and sea floor spreading were supported by reliable scientific data and combined to develop modern‐day **plate tectonic theory.**
    - The theory maintains that the crust and uppermost mantle, or lithosphere, is segmented into a number of solid, rigid slabs called **lithospheric plates**.
    - These slabs move slowly over the asthenosphere, the 200‐kilometer‐thick zone of more plastic mantle material that underlies the plates.
    - New oceanic crust is created at the crests of the midoceanic ridges and pushed laterally away by new accumulations of crust. It begins to cool as it moves away from the high heat flows at the ridge.
    - By the time it is subducted at the convergent boundary with another plate, it is cold and dense enough that it begins to sink back into the mantle.
    - Subduction is also probably a function of a down‐turning mantle convection current below the converging plates.

### Plate Tectonics Theory

**Theory:**

- Plate tectonics(from the Late Latin tectonicus, from the  Greek:  τεκτονικός  **“pertaining to building”)**is a scientific theory describing the large-scale motion of 7 large plates and the movements of a larger number of smaller plates of the Earth‘s lithosphere, over the last hundreds of millions of years.
- The theoretical model **builds on the concept of continental drift developed during the first few decades of the 20th century**. The geo scientific community accepted plate-tectonic theory after seafloor spreading was validated in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
- The lithosphere, which is the **rigid outermost shell of a planet** (the crust and upper mantle), is broken up **into tectonic plates**. The Earth’s lithosphere is composed of seven or eight major plates (depending on how they are defined) and many minor plates.
- Where the plates meet, their **relative motion determines the type of boundary:** **convergent, divergent, or transform**.
- Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation occur along these plate boundaries. The relative movement of the plates typically ranges from zero to 100 mm annually.
- Tectonic plates are composed of oceanic lithosphere and thicker continental lithosphere, each topped by its own kind of crust.
- **Along convergent boundaries**, subduction  carries plates into the mantle; the material lost is roughly balanced by the formation of new (oceanic) crust along divergent margins by seafloor spreading.
- In this way, **the total surface of the lithosphere remains the same.** This prediction of plate tectonics is also referred to as the conveyor belt principle. Earlier theories, since disproven, proposed gradual shrinking (contraction) or gradual expansion of the globe.
- Tectonic plates are able to move because the Earth’s lithosphere has greater strength than the underlying **asthenoshere**.
- **Lateral density variations** in the mantle result in convection.
- **Plate movement** is thought to be driven by a combination of the motion of the seafloor away from the spreading ridge (due to variations in topography and density of the crust, which result in differences in gravitational forces) and drag, with downward suction, at the subduction zones.
- Another explanation lies in the different forces generated by tidal forces of the Sun and Moon.
- The relative importance of each of these factors and their relationship to each other is unclear, and still the subject of much debate.

Types of Plate Boundaries

![Types of Plate Boundaries](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Types-of-Plate-Boundaries.jpg)

![Types of Plate Boundaries](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Types-of-Plate-Boundaries.jpg?resize=145%2C347&ssl=1)

**A divergent boundary**

- - - **A divergent boundary**occurs when two tectonic plates move away from each other.
    - Along these boundaries, lava spews from long fissures and geysers spurt superheated water.
    - Frequent earthquakes strike along the rift. Beneath the rift, magma—molten rock—rises from the mantle.
    - It oozes up into the gap and hardens into solid rock, forming new crust on the torn edges of the plates.
    - Magma from the mantle solidifies into basalt, a dark, dense rock that underlies the ocean floor.
    - Thus at divergent boundaries, oceanic crust, made of basalt, is created.

**Convergent boundary**

- When two plates come together, it is known as a **convergent boundary**.
- The impact of the two **colliding plates** buckles the edge of one or both plates up into a rugged mountain range, and sometimes bends the other down into a deep seafloor trench.
- A chain **of volcanoes** often forms parallel to the boundary, to the mountain range, and to the trench.
- **Powerful earthquakes** shake a wide area on both sides of the boundary.
- If one of the colliding plates is topped with oceanic crust, it is forced down into the mantle where it begins to melt.
- Magma rises into and through the other plate, solidifying into new crust. Magma formed from melting plates solidifies into granite, a light colored, low-density rock that **makes up the continents.**
- Thus at convergent boundaries, continental crust, made of granite, is created, and oceanic crust is destroyed.

**Transform plate boundary**

- Two plates sliding past each other forms a **transform plate boundary**.
- Natural or human-made structures that cross a transform boundary are offset—split into pieces and carried in opposite directions.
- Rocks that line the boundary are pulverized as the plates grind along, creating a linear fault valley or undersea canyon.
- As the plates alternately jam and jump against each other, earthquakes rattle through a wide boundary zone.
- In contrast to convergent and divergent boundaries, **no magma is formed.**
- Thus, crust is cracked and broken at transform margins, but is not created or destroyed.

**Latest findings made in understanding Plate Tectonics:-**

- - - Axial seamount = It refers to a live recording of volcano mountain. The volcano rising from Juan de fuca ridge demonstrates it. It supports the divergent movement.
    - After 2012 Sumatra Indonesia earthquake in Indian ocean the Indo Australian plate broken into many plate. It was mainly due to slipping of plate in interpolated and hence the activation of Barren volcano happened.
    - **Zealandia**:-It’s a new continent. It broke from Antarctica 100 million years and from Australia 80 million yrs ago. Its formation supports movement of plates.
    - Heat from the base of the mantle contributes significantly to the strength of the flow of heat in the mantle and to the resultant plate tectonics. Buoyancy is created by heat rising up from deep within the Earth’s core.

[**How  plate tectonics is an improvement over continental drift theory?**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2018/04/21/secure-synopsis-17-april-2018-2/)

- Plate tectonic explains the mechanism of the motion of the tectonic plates while continental drift theory left this question completely unanswered.
- Tectonic plates have been constantly moving over the globe throughout the history of the earth**. It is not the continent that moves as believed by Wegener. Continents are part of a plate and what moves is the plate.**
- Wegener had thought of all the continents to have initially existed as a super continent in the form of Pangaea. However, **later discoveries reveal that the continental masses, resting on the plates, have been wandering all through the geological period**, and Pangaea was a result of converging of different continental masses that were parts of one or the other plates.
- At the time that Wegener proposed his theory of continental drift, most scientists believed that the earth was a solid, motionless body. **However, concepts of sea floor spreading and the unified theory of plate tectonics have emphasised that both the surface of the earth and the interior are not static and motionless but are dynamic**.
  - **Sea floor spreading:-**
    - The mobile rock beneath the rigid plates is believed to be moving in a circular manner. The heated material rises to the surface, spreads and begins to cool, and then sinks back into deeper depths. This cycle is repeated over and over to generate what scientists call a convection cell or convective flow
  - The ultimate proof of this was the discovery of **“magnetic stripes”**on the seafloor later in the 1960s: the magnetic domains in oceanic rocks recorded reversal of Earth’s magnetic field over time. The pattern was symmetric to the ridge, supporting the idea of symmetric seafloor spreading**.** The idea of **subduction zones**was born
  - With **plate tectonics** we have a theory that explains Wegener’s observations and how lithosphere can be produced and consumed so that Earth does not change its size
- Wegener’s continental drift theory lacked was a propelling mechanism. Other scientists wanted to know what was moving these continents around. Unfortunately, Wegener could not provide a convincing answer. **The technological advances necessitated by the Second World War made possible the accumulation of significant evidence now underlying modern plate tectonic theory.**
- **The following two forces are too small to bring in change :-**
  - **Pole-fleeing or centrifugal force:**
    - The spinning of Earth on its own axis creates a centrifugal force i.e. force oriented away from the axis of  rotation towards the equator. Wegener believed the centrifugal force of the planet caused the super continent to break apart and pushed continents away from the Poles toward the equator. Therefore, He called this drifting  mechanism as the “pole-fleeing or centrifugal force”
  - **Tidal force:-**
    - Wegener tried to attribute the westward drift of the Americas to lunar-solar drag i.e. by invoking tidal force that is the gravitational forces of the sun and the moon .He also admitted that it is probable that pole- fleeing or centrifugal force and tidal force are responsible for the journey of continents. Wegener failed to devise a sound mechanism for the movement of the continents. For Wegener the drifting mechanism was the most difficult question to solve.
  - **Plate tectonics is the grand unifying theory of geosciences that explains**
    - Movement of continents
    - Earthquakes, volcanism most major features on Earth’s surface, including mountain building, formation of new lithosphere ,consumption of old lithosphere, mid-ocean ridges

## Second Order

Continental features that are classified in the second order of relief include continental masses, mountain masses, plateaus, plains and lowlands. A few examples are the Himalayas, Alps, Rocky Mountains, Andes, Tibetan plateau, plateau of Anatolia (Turkey), Indo-Gangetic plains, Siberian lowlands and the plains of Mississippi. The great rock cores (shields) that form the heart of each continental mass arc of this order.

In the ocean basins, the second order of relief includes continental rises, slopes, abyssal plains, mid-ocean ridges, submarine canyons, and subduction trenches.

### Mountains

Mountains can be defined as a large natural elevation of the earth’s surface rising abruptly from the surrounding level.

### Plateaus

Plateau is extensive area of flat upland usually bounded by an escarpment (i.e., steep slope) on all sides but sometimes enclosed by mountains. The essential criteria for plateaus are low relative relief and some altitude.

### Plains

In geography, a plain refers to a flat area with little or no changes in elevation. It is one of the world’s major landforms.

## Internal forces & their impact

Forces working within the earth’s surface are called endogenic forces.  
Endogenic forces are the pressure within the earth, also known as internal forces. Such internal forces contribute to vertical and horizontal motions and lead to subsidence, land upliftment, volcanism, faulting, folding, earthquakes, etc.

Sudden geomorphic movements occur mostly at the **lithospheric plate margins** (tectonic plate margins).The plate margins are highly unstable regions due to pressure created by pushing and pulling of magma in the mantle (**convectional currents**).These movements cause considerable deformation over a short period of time.

Volcanism and Earthquakes are caused as a result of sudden movements due to earth’s endogenic forces.

### Volcanism

#### Volcano

**A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object**, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. **The process is called Volcanism** and has been ongoing on Earth since the initial stages of its evolution over 4 billion years ago.

Volcanoes are Earth’s geologic architects. They’ve created more than 80 percent of our planet’s surface, laying the foundation that has allowed life to thrive. Their explosive force crafts mountains as well as craters. **Lava rivers** spread into bleak landscapes. But as time ticks by, the elements break down these volcanic rocks, liberating nutrients from their stony prisons and creating **remarkably fertile soils** that have allowed civilizations to flourish.

![Volcano](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Volcano-structure.jpg?fit=512%2C345&ssl=1)

There are **volcanoes on every continent**, even Antarctica. Some 1,500 volcanoes are still considered potentially active around the world today; 161 of those—over 10 percent—sit within the boundaries of the United States.

But each volcano is different. Some burst to life in explosive eruptions, like the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, and others burp rivers of lava in what’s known as an effusive eruption, like the 2018 activity of Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano. These differences are due to the **chemistry driving the molten activity**. **Effusive eruptions** are more common when the **magma is less viscous, or runny,** which allows gas to escape and the magma to flow down the volcano’s slopes. **Explosive eruptions, however, happen when viscous molten rock traps the gasses,** building pressure until it violently breaks free.

#### Formation of Volcanoes

- The majority of volcanoes in the world form **along the boundaries of Earth’s tectonic plates**—massive expanses of our planet’s lithosphere that continually shift, bumping into one another.
- **When tectonic plates collide**, one often plunges deep below the other in what’s known as a **subduction zone.**
- As the descending landmass sinks deep into the Earth, temperatures and pressures climb, releasing water from the rocks.
- The water slightly reduces the melting point of the overlying rock, forming magma that can work its way to the surface—the spark of life to reawaken a slumbering volcano.
- Not all volcanoes are related to **subduction,**
- Another way volcanoes can form is what’s known as **hotspot volcanism**.
- In this situation, a zone of magmatic activity—or a hotspot—in the middle of a tectonic plate can push up through the crust to form a volcano.
- Although the hotspot itself is thought to be largely stationary, the tectonic plates continue their slow march, building a line of volcanoes or islands on the surface. This mechanism is thought to be behind the **Hawaii volcanic chain.**

#### Location of Volcanoes

- Some 75 percent of the world’s active volcanoes are positioned around the **ring of fire\*\***,\*\* a 25,000-mile long, horseshoe-shaped zone that stretches from the southern tip of South America across the West Coast of North America, through the Bering Sea to Japan, and on to New Zealand.
- This region is where the **edges of the Pacific and Nazca plates** butt up against an array of other tectonic plates. Importantly, however, the volcanoes of the ring **aren’t geologically connected**. In other words, a volcanic eruption in Indonesia is not related to one in Alaska, and it could not stir the infamous Yellowstone supervolcano.

#### Reasons for Concentration of volcanoes along the Ring of Fire

The Ring of Fire is a **string of volcanoes and sites of seismic activity, or earthquakes, around the edges of the Pacific Ocean.** Roughly 90% of all earthquakes occur along the Ring of Fire, and the ring is dotted with **75% of all active volcanoes on Earth.**

The Ring of Fire isn’t quite a circular ring. It is shaped more like a 40,000-kilometer (25,000-mile) horseshoe. A string of 452 volcanoes stretches from the southern tip of South America, up along the coast of North America, across the Bering Strait, down through Japan, and into New Zealand. Several active and dormant volcanoes in Antarctica, however, “close” the ring.

**Plate Boundaries**

The Ring of Fire is the **result of plate tectonics**. Tectonic plates are huge slabs of the Earth’s crust, which fit together like pieces of a puzzle. The plates are not fixed but are constantly moving atop a layer of solid and molten rock called the mantle. Sometimes these plates collide, move apart, or slide next to each other. **Most tectonic activity in the Ring of Fire occurs in these geologically active zones.**

**Convergent Boundaries**

A convergent plate boundary is formed by **tectonic plates crashing into each other.** Convergent boundaries are often **subduction zones**, where the heavier plate slips under the lighter plate, creating a deep trench. This subduction **changes the dense mantle material into buoyant magma, which rises through the crust to the Earth’s surface.** Over millions of years, the rising magma creates a series of active volcanoes known as a **volcanic arc.**

If you were to drain the water out of the Pacific Ocean, you would see a series of **deep ocean trenches that run parallel to corresponding volcanic arcs along the Ring of Fire.** These arcs create both islands and continental mountain ranges.

**The Aleutian Islands in the U.S. state of Alaska, for example, run parallel to the Aleutian Trench.** Both geographic features continue to form as the Pacific Plate subducts beneath the North American Plate. The Aleutian Trench reaches a maximum depth of 7,679 meters (25,194 feet). The Aleutian Islands have 27 of the United States’ 65 historically active volcanoes.

The **Andes Mountains of South America run parallel to the Peru-Chile Trench, created as the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South American Plate.** The **Andes Mountains** include the **world’s highest active volcano, Nevados Ojos del Salado,** which rises to 6,879 meters (over 22,500 feet) along the Chile-Argentina border. Many volcanoes in Antarctica are so geologically linked to the South American part of the Ring of Fire that some geologists refer to the region as the “Antarctandes.”

**Divergent** **Boundarie\*\***s\*\*

A divergent boundary is formed by **tectonic plates pulling apart from each other.** Divergent boundaries are the site of **seafloor spreading and rift valleys.** Seafloor spreading is the process of magma welling up in the rift as the old crust pulls itself in opposite directions. Cold seawater cools the magma, creating new crust. The upward movement and eventual cooling of this magma has created high ridges on the ocean floor over millions of years.

**The East Pacific Rise is a site of major seafloor spreading in the Ring of Fire.** The East Pacific Rise is located on the divergent boundary of the Pacific Plate and the Cocos Plate (west of Central America), the Nazca Plate (west of South America), and the Antarctic Plate. In addition to volcanic activity, the rise also has a number of hydrothermal vents.

**T\*\***ransform Boundaries\*\*

A transform boundary is formed as tectonic plates **slide horizontally past each other.**

Parts of these plates get stuck at the places where they touch. Stress builds in those areas as the rest of the plates continue to move. This stress causes the rock to break or slip, suddenly lurching the plates forward and causing earthquakes.

These areas of **breakage or slippage are called faults.** The majority of Earth’s faults can be found along transform boundaries in the Ring of Fire.

**The San Andreas Fault**, stretching along the central west coast of North America, is one of the **most active faults on the Ring of Fire.**

It lies on the transform boundary between the North American Plate, which is moving south, and the Pacific Plate, which is moving north.

Measuring about 1,287 kilometers (800 miles) long and 16 kilometers (10 miles) deep, the fault cuts through the western part of the U.S. state of California. Movement along the fault caused the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which destroyed nearly 500 city blocks. The earthquake and accompanying fires killed roughly 3,000 people and left half of the city’s residents homeless.

Hot Spots

**The Ring of Fire is also home to hot spots,** areas deep within the Earth’s mantle from which heat rises. This heat facilitates the melting of rock in the brittle, upper portion of the mantle. The melted rock, known as magma, often pushes through cracks in the crust to form volcanoes.

Hot spots are not generally associated with the interaction or movement of Earth’s tectonic plates. For this reason, many geologists do not consider hot spot volcanoes part of the Ring of Fire.

**Mount Erebus, the most southern active volcano on Earth, sits over the eruptive zone of the Erebus hot spot in Antarctica.** This glacier-covered volcano has a lava lake at its summit and has been consistently erupting since it was first discovered in 1841.

**Active Volcanoes in the Ring of Fire**

- Most of the active volcanoes on The Ring of Fire are found on its western edge, **from the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia, through the islands of Japan and Southeast Asia, to New Zealand.**
- **Mount Ruapehu** in New Zealand is one of the more active volcanoes in the Ring of Fire, with yearly minor eruptions, and major eruptions occurring about every 50 years. It stands 2,797 meters (9,177 feet) high. Mount Ruapehu is part of the Taupo Volcanic Arc, where the dense Pacific Plate is subducting beneath the Australian Plate.
- **Krakatau, perhaps better known as Krakatoa, is an island volcano in Indonesia.** Krakatoa erupts less often than Mount Ruapehu, but much more spectacularly. Beneath Krakatoa, the denser Australian Plate is being subducted beneath the Eurasian Plate. An infamous eruption in 1883 destroyed the entire island, sending volcanic gas, volcanic ash, and rocks as high as 80 kilometers (50 miles) in the air. A new island volcano, Anak Krakatau, has been forming with minor eruptions ever since.
- **Mount Fuji,** Japan’s tallest and most famous mountain, is an active volcano in the Ring of Fire. Mount Fuji last erupted in 1707, but recent earthquake activity in eastern Japan may have put the volcano in a “critical state.” Mount Fuji sits at a “triple junction,” where three tectonic plates (the Amur Plate, Okhotsk Plate, and Philippine Plate) interact.
- The Ring of Fire’s eastern half also has a number of active volcanic areas, including the **Aleutian Islands, the Cascade Mountains in the western U.S., the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, and the Andes Mountains.**
- **Mount St. Helens**, in the U.S. state of Washington, is an active volcano in the Cascade Mountains. Below Mount St. Helens, the Juan de Fuca plate is being subducted beneath the North American Plate. Mount St. Helens lies on a particularly weak section of crust, which makes it more prone to eruptions. Its historic 1980 eruption lasted 9 hours and covered nearby areas in tons of volcanic ash.
- **Popocatépetl is one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the Ring of Fire.** The mountain is one of Mexico’s most active volcanoes, with 15 recorded eruptions since 1519. The volcano lies on the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, which is the result of the small Cocos Plate subducting beneath the North American Plate. Located close to the urban areas of Mexico City and Puebla, Popocatépetl poses a risk to the more than 20 million people that live close enough to be threatened by a destructive eruption.

#### Volcanic Landforms

Volcanic landforms are divided into extrusive and intrusive landforms based on weather magma cools within the crust or above the crust. Rocks formed by either **plutonic** (cooling of magma within the crust) or **volcanic** (cooling of lava above the surface) are called ‘**Igneous rocks’**.

#### Effects of Volcanism

**Destructive effects of volcanism:**

- - Volcanism can be a greatly damaging natural disaster. The damage is caused by advancing lava which engulfs whole cities. Habitats and landscapes are destroyed by lava flows.
  - Showers of cinders and bombs can cause **damage to life.**
  - Violent earthquakes associated with volcanic activity and mud flows of volcanic ash saturated by heavy rain **can bury nearby places.**
  - Sometimes ash can precipitate under the influence of rain and completely cover the surrounding regions.
  - **Health concerns** after a **volcanic**eruption include infectious disease, respiratory illness, burns, injuries from falls, and vehicle accidents related to the slippery, hazy conditions caused by ash.
  - Further effects are the **deterioration of water quality**, fewer periods of rain, crop damages, and the destruction of vegetation.
  - In coastal areas, seismic sea waves called tsunamis are an additional danger which are generated by submarine earth faults where volcanism is active.

**Positive effects of volcanism:**

- - Volcanism **creates new landforms** like islands, plateaus,volcanic mountains etc. For example: Deccan plateau, Mt. Vesuvius.
  - The **volcanic ash and dust** are very fertile for farms and orchards.
  - **Volcanic rocks yield very fertile soil** upon weathering and decomposition.
  - Although steep volcano slopes prevent extensive agriculture, forestry operations on them provide **valuable timber resources**.
  - Mineral resources, particularly metallic ores are brought to the surface by volcanoes. Sometimes copper and other ores fill the gas bubble cavities. The **famed Kimberlite rock of South Africa, source of diamonds is the pipe of an ancient volcano.**
  - Lava rock is extensively used as a source of crushed rock for concrete aggregate or rail road ballast, and other engineering purposes
  - In the vicinity of active volcanoes, waters in the depth are heated from contact with hot magma giving rise **to springs and geysers.** The heat from the earth’s interior in areas of volcanic activity is used to **generate geothermal electricity.**
  - Countries producing geothermal power include USA, Russia, Japan, Italy, New Zealand and Mexico.
  - At many places volcanic landforms attract heavy tourist traffic. At several places national parks have been set up centred around volcanoes.

#### Measures to mitigate volcanic disasters

- One of the most effective ways of reducing the risk of a volcanic eruption is having an evacuation plan. This involves ensuring evacuation strategies are in place along with emergency shelter and food supplies being planned for.
- Based on monitoring data, exclusion zones can be set up to ensure people are evacuated from areas likely to be affected before an eruption.
- Local people can also be educated about actions they can take to reduce the risk of loss of life or injury.
- People are taught that if they are unable to be evacuated what they should do to protect themselves, e.g. go indoors to avoid falling ash and rock.

### Earthquakes

#### Introduction

- - An earthquake, in simple words, is shaking of the earth. It is a natural event.
  - It is caused due to release of energy, which generates waves that travel in all directions.
  - The point where the earthquake starts is called the **focus or hypocentre** of an earthquake.
  - The energy waves travelling in different directions reach the surface.
  - The point on the surface, nearest to the focus, is called **epicentre**. It is the first one to experience the waves.
  - It is generally, epicentre, which is shown as the location of earthquake in media and other channels.

#### Causes of Earthquakes

- Earthquakes are caused due to release of energy. The release of energy occurs along a fault. A fault is a sharp break in the crustal rocks. Rocks along a fault tend to move in opposite directions. As the overlying rock strata press them, the friction locks them together.
- However, their tendency to move apart at some point of time overcomes the friction. As a result, the blocks get deformed and eventually, they slide past one another abruptly. This causes a release of energy, and the energy waves travel in all directions.

This release of energy, along a fault line, may be due to several factors. They may be categorised as:

**Natural causes**

**Tectonic earthquakes**

- The earth has four major layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle and crust. The crust and the top of the mantle make up a thin skin on the surface of our planet.
- The Earth’s crust consists of seven large lithospheric plates and numerous smaller plates and the edges of the plates are called the **plate boundaries**. These plates move towards each other (a convergent boundary), apart (a divergent boundary) or past each other (a transform boundary).

- The plate boundaries are made up of many faults, and most of the earthquakes around the world occur on these faults. Earthquakes are caused by a sudden release of stress along these faults in the earth’s crust.
- As seen in below figure, most of the earthquakes take place along the plate boundaries. A rather more susceptible region around the pacific plate is called **‘ring of fire’** due to very high frequency of earthquakes in the region.

- The continuous motion of tectonic plates causes a steady build-up of pressure in the rock strata on both sides of a fault. It continues until the stress is sufficiently great that it is released in a sudden, jerky movement. The resulting waves of seismic energy propagate through the ground and over its surface, causing the shaking we perceive as earthquakes.
- There are mainly 3 types of faults along the plate boundaries as shown in **figure**

**Volcanic earthquakes**

- Volcanic earthquakes are caused by slip on a fault near a volcano. Volcanoes are often found in areas of crustal weakness and the mass of the volcano its self adds to the regional strain.
- They occur as a result of regional strain exerted in an area of weak faults. They can also be generated from changes of pressure under the volcano caused by the injection or removal of magma (molten rock) from the volcanic system.
- After the withdrawal of magma from a system, an empty space is left to be filled. The result is a collapse of surrounding rock to fill the void, also creating earthquakes.
- They are generally not as powerful as tectonic quakes and often occur relatively near the surface. Consequently, they are usually only felt in the vicinity of the hypocentre.

**Anthropogenic causes or induced seismicity**

- Induced seismicity refers to typically minor earthquakes and tremors that are caused by human activity that alters the stresses and strains on the Earth’s crust. Most induced seismicity is of a low magnitude.
- In the areas of intense mining activity, sometimes the roofs of underground mines collapse causing minor tremors. These are called **collapse earthquakes.**
- Ground shaking may also occur due to the explosion of chemical or nuclear devices. Such tremors are called **explosion earthquakes.**
- The earthquakes that occur in the areas of large reservoirs are referred to as **reservoir induced earthquakes**.

#### Distribution of Earthquakes

Earthquakes can strike any location at any time, but history shows they occur in the same general patterns year after year, principally in three large zones of the earth:

- **Circum-Pacific seismic belt**: The world’s greatest earthquake belt is found along the rim of the Pacific Ocean, where about 81 per cent of our planet’s largest earthquakes occur. It is also known as “Ring of Fire”.
- **Alpide earthquake belt**: It extends from Java to Sumatra through the Himalayas, the Mediterranean, and out into the Atlantic. This belt accounts for about 17 percent of the world’s largest earthquakes.
- **Submerged mid-Atlantic Ridge**: The ridge marks where two tectonic plates are spreading apart (a divergent plate boundary).

#### Earthquake Waves

- Release of energy during earthquake generates waves which are called Earthquake Waves. Earthquake waves are basically of two types — body waves and surface waves.
- **Body waves:** They are generated due to the release of energy at the focus and move in all directions travelling through the body of the earth. Hence, the name body waves. The body waves interact with the surface rocks and generate new set of waves called surface waves.
- **Surface waves:** These waves move along the surface. The velocity of waves changes as they travel through materials with different densities. The denser the material, the higher is the velocity. Their direction also changes as they reflect or refract when coming across materials with different densities.

There are two types of body waves. They are called P and S-waves.

- **P-waves** **or ‘primary waves**’ move faster and are the first to arrive at the surface. The P-waves are similar to sound waves. They travel through gaseous, liquid and solid materials.
- P-waves vibrate _parallel_ to the direction of the wave. This exerts pressure on the material in the direction of the propagation. As a result, it creates density differences in the material leading to stretching and squeezing of the material.
- **S-waves or secondary waves** arrive at the surface with some time lag. They can travel only through solid materials. This characteristic of the S-waves is quite important. It has helped scientists to understand the structure of the interior of the earth.
- The direction of vibrations of S-waves is _perpendicular_ to the wave direction in the vertical plane. Hence, they create troughs and crests in the material through which they pass. Surface waves are considered to be the most damaging waves.

**Shadow zones**

- There exist some specific areas where the waves are not reported by seismograph. Such a zone is called the ‘shadow zone’. The study of different events reveals that for each earthquake, there exists an altogether different shadow zone.
- Figure 6 shows the shadow zones of P and S-waves. It was observed that seismographs located at any distance within 105° from the epicentre, recorded the arrival of both P and S-waves. However, the seismographs located beyond 145° from epicentre record the arrival of P-waves, but not that of S-waves.
- Thus, a zone between 105° and 145° from epicentre was identified as the shadow zone for both the types of waves.
- The entire zone beyond 105° does not receive S-waves.
- The shadow zone of S-wave is much larger than that of the P-waves.
- The shadow zone of P-waves appears as a band around the earth between 105° and 145° away from the epicentre. The shadow zone of S-waves is not only larger in extent but it is also a little over 40 per cent of the earth surface.

#### Measuring Earthquakes

- The earthquake events are scaled either according to the magnitude or intensity of the shock.
- The magnitude scale is known as the **Richter scale**. The magnitude indicates energy released during the quake. It is expressed in absolute numbers 0-10.
- The **intensity scale** is named after Mercalli, an Italian seismologist. The intensity scale indicates the visible damage caused by the event. The range of intensity scale is from 1-12.

#### Effects of Earthquakes

Earthquakes have all encompassing disastrous effects on the area of their occurrence. Some of the important ones are listed in Table

#### Reasons for the Earthquake proneness in India

- The major reason for the high frequency and intensity of the earthquakes is that the Indian plate is driving into Eurasia at a rate of approximately 47 mm/year.
- **Himalayan belt:** Collision between Indo-Austral plate with Eurasian plate and Burma Plate with Java Sumatra plate. This collision causes lots of strain in underlying rocks’ energy of which is released in the form of earthquakes.
- **Andaman and Nicobar Islands**: Seafloor displacement and underwater volcanoes which disturb the equilibrium of earth’s surface.
- **Deccan Plateau**: some earth scientists have come up with a theory of the emergence of a fault line and energy build-up along the fault line of the river Bhima (Krishna) near Latur and Osmanabad (Maharashtra).
- Increasing population and unscientific land use for construction make India a high-risk land for earthquakes.
