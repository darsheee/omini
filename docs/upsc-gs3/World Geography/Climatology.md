## Structure, Composition of Atmosphere

### Atmosphere

- Earth is a unique planet because life is found only on this planet.
- The air has a special place among the conditions necessary for life.
- The air is a mixture of several gases.
- The air encompasses the earth from all sides.
- The air surrounding the Earth is called the atmosphere.
- The atmosphere is an integral part of our Earth.
- It is connected with the earth due to the gravitational force of the earth.
- It helps in stopping the ultra violet rays harmful for the life and maintain the suitable temperature necessary for life.
- The air is essential for the survival of all forms of life on the earth. One cannot imagine any kind of life in the absence of it. The atmosphere is like a large protective cover.
- Besides many gases, water vapour and dust particles are also found in the atmosphere.

### Structure of the Atmosphere

**Thermal Structure of the Atmosphere**

Atmospheric layers are characterized by **variations in temperature** resulting primarily from the absorption of solar radiation; visible light at the surface, near ultraviolet radiation in the middle atmosphere, and far ultraviolet radiation in the upper atmosphere.

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Structure-Composition-of-atmosphere1.jpg)

**Troposphere**

- The troposphere is the atmospheric **layer closest to the planet** and contains the largest percentage (around 80%) of the mass of the total atmosphere.
- Temperature and water vapor content in the troposphere **decrease rapidly with altitude.**
- Water vapor plays a major role in regulating air temperature because it absorbs solar energy and thermal radiation from the planet’s surface.
- The troposphere contains **99 % of the water vapor** in the atmosphere.
- Water vapor concentrations vary with latitude. They are greatest above the tropics, where they may be as high as 3 %, and decrease toward the polar regions.
- **All weather phenomena** occur within the troposphere, although turbulence may extend into the lower portion of the stratosphere.
- Troposphere means “**region of mixing**” and is so named because of vigorous convective air currents within the layer.
- The upper boundary of the layer, known as the **tropopause**, ranges in height from **5 miles (8 km) near the poles up to 11 miles (18 km) above the equator.** Its height also varies with the seasons; highest in the summer and lowest in the winter.

**Stratosphere**

- The stratosphere is the second major strata of air in the atmosphere.
- It extends above the tropopause to an altitude of about 30 miles (50 km) above the planet’s surface.
- The air temperature in the stratosphere remains relatively constant up to an altitude of 15 miles (25 km).
- Then it increases gradually to up to the stratopause.
- Because the **air temperature** in the stratosphere **increases with altitude**, it does not cause convection and has a stabilizing effect on atmospheric conditions in the region.
- **Ozone** plays the major role in regulating the **thermal regime of the stratosphere**, as water vapor content within the layer is very low.
  - **Temperature increases with ozone concentration**.
  - Solar energy is converted to kinetic energy when ozone molecules absorb ultraviolet radiation, resulting in heating of the stratosphere.
  - The ozone layer is centered at an altitude between 10-15 miles (15-25 km).
  - Approximately **90 % of the ozone in the atmosphere resides in the stratosphere**.
  - Ozone concentration in this region is about 10 parts per million by volume (ppmv) as compared to approximately 0.04 ppmv in the troposphere.
  - **Ozone absorbs the bulk of solar ultraviolet radiation** in wavelengths from 290 nm – 320 nm (UV-B radiation). These **wavelengths are harmful** to life because they can be absorbed by the nucleic acid in cells.
  - Increased penetration of ultraviolet radiation to the planet’s surface would damage plant life and have harmful environmental consequences.
  - Appreciably large amounts of solar ultraviolet radiation would result in a host of biological effects, such as a dramatic increase in cancers.

**Mesosphere**

- The mesosphere a layer extending from approximately **30 to 50 miles (50 to 85 km)** above the surface, is characterized by **decreasing temperatures.**
- The **coldest temperatures** in Earth’s atmosphere occur at the **top of this layer**, the mesopause, especially in the summer near the pole.
- The mesosphere has sometimes jocularly been referred to as the “ignorosphere” because it had been probably the least studied of the atmospheric layers.
- The stratosphere and mesosphere together are sometimes referred to as the **middle atmosphere.**

**Thermosphere**

- The thermosphere is located above the mesosphere.
- The temperature in the thermosphere **generally increases with altitude** reaching 600 to 3000 F (600-2000 K) depending on solar activity.
- This increase in temperature is due to the absorption of intense solar radiation by the limited amount of remaining molecular oxygen.
- At this extreme altitude gas molecules are widely separated.
- Above 60 miles (100 km) from Earth’s surface the chemical composition of air becomes strongly dependent on altitude and the atmosphere becomes enriched with lighter gases (atomic oxygen, helium and hydrogen).
- Also at 60 miles (100 km) altitude, Earth’s atmosphere becomes too thin to support aircraft and vehicles need to travel at orbital velocities to stay aloft.
- This demarcation between aeronautics and astronautics is known as **the Karman Line.**
- Above about 100 miles (160 km) altitude the major atmospheric component becomes atomic oxygen.
- At very high altitudes, the residual gases begin to stratify according to molecular mass, because of gravitational separation.

**Exosphere**

- The exosphere is the most distant atmospheric region from Earth’s surface.
- In the exosphere, an upward travelling molecule can escape to space (if it is moving fast enough) or be pulled back to Earth by gravity (if it isn’t) with little probability of colliding with another molecule.
- The altitude of its lower boundary, known as the **thermopause or exobase,** ranges from about 150 to 300 miles (250-500 km) depending on solar activity.
- The upper boundary can be defined theoretically by the altitude (about 120,000 miles, half the distance to the Moon) at which the influence of solar radiation pressure on atomic hydrogen velocities exceeds that of the Earth’s gravitational pull.
- The exosphere observable from space as the **geocorona** is seen to extend to at least 60,000 miles from the surface of the Earth.
- The exosphere is **a transitional zone** between Earth’s atmosphere and interplanetary space.

**Magneto-electronic Structure of the Atmosphere**

The upper atmosphere is also divided into regions based on the behaviour and number of free electrons and other charged particles.

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Structure-Composition-of-atmosphere2.jpg)

**Ionosphere**

- The ionosphere is defined by atmospheric effects on **radiowave propagation** as a result of the presence and variation in concentration **of free electrons** in the atmosphere.
- The ionosphere above the peak electron concentration is usually referred to as the **Topside Ionosphere.**

**Plasmasphere**

[![Structure, Composition of Atmosphere](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Structure-Composition-of-atmosphere3.jpg)

![Structure, Composition of Atmosphere](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Structure-Composition-of-atmosphere3.jpg?resize=525%2C297&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Structure-Composition-of-atmosphere3.jpg)

- The plasmasphere is not really spherical but **a doughnut-shaped region** (a torus) with the hole aligned with Earth’s magnetic axis.
- The Earth’s plasmasphere is made of just that, a plasma, the fourth state of matter.
- This plasma is composed mostly of hydrogen ions (protons) and electrons. It has a very sharp edge called the **_plasmapause_**.
- The outer edge of this doughnut over the equator is usually some 4 to 6 Earth radii from the center of the Earth or 12,000-20,000 miles (19,000-32,000 km) above the surface. The plasmasphere is essentially an extension of the ionosphere.
- **Inside of the** **plasmapause, geomagnetic field lines rotate with the Earth.**
- The inner edge of the plasmasphere is taken as the altitude at which protons replace oxygen as the dominant species in the ionospheric plasma which usually occurs at about 600 miles (1000 km) altitude.
- The plasmasphere can also be considered to be a structure **within the magnetosphere.**

**Magnetosphere**

[![Structure, Composition of Atmosphere](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Structure-Composition-of-atmosphere4.jpg)

![Structure, Composition of Atmosphere](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Structure-Composition-of-atmosphere4.jpg?resize=504%2C360&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Structure-Composition-of-atmosphere4.jpg)

- Outside the plasmapause, magnetic field lines are unable to corotate because they are influenced strongly by electric fields of solar wind origin.
- The magnetosphere is a cavity (also not spherical) in which the Earth’s magnetic field is constrained by the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF).
- The outer boundary of the magnetosphere is called the **_magnetopause_.**
- The magnetosphere is shaped like an **elongated teardrop** (like a Christmas Tree ornament) with the tail pointing away from the Sun.
- The magnetopause is typically located at about 10 Earth radii or some 35,000 miles (about 56,000 km) above the Earth’s surface on the day side and stretches into a long tail, the *magnetotail*, a few million miles long (about 1000 Earth radii), well past the orbit of the Moon (at around 60 Earth radii), on the night side of the Earth.
- However, the Moon itself is usually not within the magnetosphere except for a couple of days around the Full Moon.
- Beyond the magnetopause are the **_magnetosheath_**and **_bow shock_** which are regions in the solar wind disturbed by the presence of Earth and its magnetic field.

### Composition of the Atmosphere

- The atmosphere is a mixture of many gases. In addition, it contains huge numbers of solid and liquid particles, collectively called **‘aerosols’.**
- Some of the gases may be regarded as **permanent atmospheric components**which remain in **fixed proportion** to the total gas volume.
- Other constituents vary in quantity from place to place and from time to time. If the suspended particles, water vapour and other variable gases were excluded from the atmosphere, then the dry air is very stable all over the earth up to an altitude of about 80 kilometres.
- The proportion of gases changes in the higher layers of the atmosphere in such a way that oxygen will be almost in negligible quantity at the height of 120 km. Similarly, carbon dioxide and water vapour are found only up to 90 km from the surface of the earth.
- **Nitrogen and oxygen**make up nearly **99%** of the clean, dry air. The remaining gases are mostly **inert** and constitute about 1% of the atmosphere.
- Besides these gases, large quantities of water vapour and dust particles are also present in the atmosphere. These solid and liquid particles are of great climatic significance.

The details of different gases of the atmosphere are given in the table below.

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Structure-Composition-of-atmosphere6.jpg)

**Different constituents of the atmosphere, with their individual characteristics, are discussed below.**

---

**Gases of the atmosphere:**

The atmosphere is the mixture of different types of gases, including water vapour and dust particles. Nitrogen and Oxygen are the two main gases of the atmosphere. 99 percent part of it is made up of these two gases. Other gases like organ, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, nion, helium etc. form the remaining part of atmosphere.

- **Nitrogen:**  
  Nitrogen accounts for **78%** of total atmospheric volume. It is a **relatively inert gas**, and is an important constituent of all organic compounds. The main function of nitrogen is to **control combustion by diluting oxygen**. It also indirectly helps in oxidation of different kinds.
- **Oxygen:**  
  Oxygen, although constituting only **21%**of total volume of atmosphere, is the most important component among gases. All living organisms inhale oxygen. Besides, oxygen can combine with other elements to form important compounds, such as, **oxides**. Also, **combustion is not possible without oxygen**.
- **Carbon dioxide:  
  **
  - The third important gas is Carbon Dioxide which constitutes only about **03%**of the dry air and is a product of combustion.
  - Green plants, through photosynthesis, absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use it to manufacture food and keep other bio-physical processes going.
  - Being an **efficient absorber of heat**, carbon dioxide is considered to be of great climatic significance.
  - Carbon dioxide is considered to be a very important factor in the **heat energy budget.**
  - With increased burning of fossil fuels – oil, coal and natural gas – the carbon dioxide percentage in the atmosphere has been increasing at an alarming rate.
  - More carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means more heat absorption. This could significantly raise the temperature at lower levels of the atmosphere thus inducing drastic climatic changes.
- **Ozone:**
  - Ozone (03) is another important gas in the atmosphere, which is actually a type of oxygen molecule consisting of three, instead of two, atoms.
  - It forms less than **0**.**00005%** by volume of the atmosphere and is **unevenly distributed**.
  - It is between **20 km and 25** km altitude that the greatest concentrations of ozone are found.
  - It is formed at higher altitudes and transported downwards.
  - Ozone plays a **crucial role in blocking the harmful ultraviolet radiation**from the sun.
  - Other gases found in almost negligible quantities in the atmosphere are **neon, helium, hydrogen, xenon, krypton, methane etc.**

---

**Water vapour**

- Gaseous form of water persent in the atmosphere is called water vapour.
- Water vapour present in the atmosphere has made life possible on the earth Water vapour is the source of all kinds of precipitation.
- Its maximum amount in the atmosphere could be **upto 4 percent.**
- Maximum amount of water vapour is found in hot-wet regions and its least amount is found in the dry regions.
- Generally, the amount of water vapour goes on decreasing from low latitudes to high latitudes.
- In the same way, its amount goes on decreasing with increasing altitude.
- Water vapour reaches in the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration.
- Evaporation takes place in the oceans, seas, rivers, ponds and lakes while transpiration takes lace from the plants, trees and living beings.

---

**Dust Particles**

- Dust particles are generally found in the lower layers of the atmosphere.
- These particles are found in the form of sand, smoke and oceanic salt.
- Sand particle have important place in the atmosphere.
- These dust particles help in the condensation of water vapour.
- During condensation water vapour gets condensed in the form of droplets around these dust particles.
- Due to this process the clouds are formed and precipitation is made possible

## Weather & Climate

### Weather, Seasons & Climate

**Weather**

- Temperature, pressure, wind, humidity and precipitation, interact with each other.
- They influence the atmospheric conditions like the direction and velocity of wind, amount of insolation, cloud-cover and the amount of precipitation. These are known as the elements of both weather and climate.
- The influence of these elements differs from place to place and time to time. It may be restricted to a small area and for a short duration of time.
- Very often this influence is described in the name of weather as sunny, hot, warm, cold, fine, etc depending upon the dominant element of weather at a place and at a point of time.
- Therefore, **weather is the atmospheric condition of a place for a short duration** with respect to its one or more elements.
- Two places even a short distance apart may have different kind of weather at one and the same time.

---

**Seasons**

![Weather & Climate](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Weather-Climate.jpg)

![Weather & Climate](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Weather-Climate.jpg?resize=525%2C394&ssl=1)

- Seasons are specified periods in a year which have similar weather conditions.
- Season is a period of the year characterized by a particular set of weather conditions resulting from **the inclination of the earth’s axis and the revolution of the earth** round the sun.
- The same cycle of season is repeated year after year.
- **Four seasons**, each of three months duration have been recognized in temperate regions.
- They are spring, summer, autumn and winter.
- In our country, we have three distinct seasons which are summer, winter and monsoons.
- The **Indian Meteorological Department** has recognized **four main seasons**.
- They are
  - Cold weather season (December to February.)
  - Hot weather seasons (March to May)
  - Advancing monsoon season or rainy season (June to September.)
  - Retreating monsoon season (October to November.)
- The rays of the sun are more or less direct on the equator throughout the year. Hence, equatorial regions experience the same temperature all the year round. Therefore, **seasons are insignificant on or near the equator.**
- Near the coast, **the oceanic influence reduces the seasonal variations**.
- In the **polar regions**, there are only two seasons i.e. long winter and short summer.

---

**Climate**

- The average weather conditions, prevalent from one season to another in the course of a year, over a large area is known as climate.
- The average of these weather conditions is calculated from the data collected for several years (about 35 years) for a larger area.
- Rajasthan, for example, experiences hot and arid climate, Kerala has tropical rainy climate, Greenland has cold desert climate and the climate of Central Asia is temperate continental.

Climate of a region is considered more or less permanent.

### The Elements of Weather and Climate

Weather is nothing more than the different elements it is composed of, as well as the way they interact with each to create different atmospheric conditions or weather events. Eight primary elements/factors drive all weather:

1.  - Temperature
    - Air (Atmospheric) Pressure
    - Wind (Speed & Direction)
    - Humidity
    - Precipitation
    - Visibility
    - Clouds (Type & Cover)
    - Sunshine Duration

---

**Temperature**

- Temperature is a measurement of the amount of **kinetic energy present in the air**, which manifests itself physically through the experience of heat or cold.
- The scales typically used to measure temperature, is **Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin**.
- The instrument used to measure temperature is called a **thermometer**.
- In more practical terms, it means that the particles in the air move or vibrate at a certain speed, which creates kinetic energy.
- When the particles start to move/rotate around faster, temperature increases.
- When the particles begin to slow down, the temperature also starts to decrease

---

**Air Pressure**

- Air pressure is another essential element of weather, especially when it comes to creating or changing atmospheric conditions.
- It is also one of the critical variables used to make accurate weather forecasts.
- Air Pressure is the result of the **pressure created by the weight of the air** in the Earth’s atmosphere.
- It is also called a **barometric pressure**, named after the instrument used to measure air pressure.
- Although it may not be visible, air has weight since it is not empty. It is filled with small particles of nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide and a few other gases.
- The weight of the particles in the air creates pressure due to the gravitational force of the Earth.
- Since more air is present above the air close to the ground, air pressure is the highest on the planet’s surface and decreases as altitude increase.
- The **barometer is the instrument** used to measure air pressure.

---

**Wind (Speed & Direction)**

- The movement of air (wind) is one of the main driving forces of weather.
- The majority of major and even extreme weather events like cold & warm fronts, clouds, thunderstorms, and hurricanes are all driven by wind.
- Wind is the **large-scale movement of air** from an area of high to an area of low pressure in the atmosphere.
- The **speed and strength of wind** are determined by the distance between the low pressure and high-pressure areas, as well as the difference in air pressure.
- The **anemometer** is the instrument used to measure wind speed.
- A **wind vane** (or weather vane) is the instrument used to measure wind direction.

---

**Humidity**

- Humidity is another weather element that cannot be seen but can be felt.
- It not only plays a big part in weather formation but also directly influence our physical comfort levels.
- Humidity is the **amount of water vapor** that is present in the atmosphere at any specific time.
- Water vapor is nothing more than water in a state of gas (after the liquid has evaporated).
- Although humidity and its effects can usually be felt, it is normally invisible to the naked eye.
- Humidity can be challenging to understand and interpret correctly.
- The **hygrometer** is the instrument used to measure wind speed.

---

**Precipitation**

- Precipitation is **water in all its different states,** which is formed **after condensation** turned water vapor into its solid form, which falls to the ground after it becomes too heavy to stay suspended in the air.
- Precipitation can take the **form of rain, snow, hail, or graupel**.
- Precipitation is primarily the result of evaporation and condensation.
- **Instrument for Measuring Rainfall** :A **rain gauge** is the instrument used to measure rainfall. It is essentially a measured container that captures rain and measures the amount that falls over a set period of time.

---

**Visibility**

- Visibility is the **measurement of the degree through which an object can be observed** over a certain distance.
- This measurement is crucial when conditions like **mist, haze, fog, and freezing drizzle** are present, which can severely impede visibility.
- The importance to be able to measure this element is often underestimated.
- It is especially applicable in areas where visibility plays a crucial role, like **airports and harbors** where it can literally be a matter of life or death.
- **Instrument for Measuring Visibility** :Visibility sensors like “**forward scatter sensor**” are the instruments used to measure visibility.

---

**Clouds (Type & Cover)**

- Clouds are **water droplets or water in different states** (like ice and snow crystals), which formed after water vapor reached condensation level and could no longer remain in gaseous form.
- Knowing how to identify a certain type of cloud and the weather associated with it, can prove valuable when assessing weather conditions with only visual references.
- **Instrument for Measuring Clouds** The advanced instruments meteorologists use to study clouds in detail are weather **satellites and radars.**
- Satellite and radar images are able to accurately measure cloud density, the amount of moisture, the temperature, and movement of the clouds.

---

**Sunshine Duration**

- Sunshine duration is the **length of time the Earth’s surface is directly exposed to solar radiation**.
- It is also referred to as **sunlight hours** and measure the amount of exposure over a set period of time (generally in hours per day or year).
- As already stated, sunshine duration influence other weather elements, which can change the whole makeup of the weather conditions.
- This ability makes it a more powerful and influential factor than you might think.
- **Instrument for Measuring Sunshine** :Sunshine recorders, more specifically **Campbell–Stokes recorders**, are the instruments used to record sunshine duration.
- Campbell–Stokes recorders basically consist of a spherical lens that focuses sunlight on a specific type of tape to make its measurement.

### Factors affecting Climate

Different regions of the world have differences in temperature, humidity and precipitation. These differences influence the lifestyle of the people living under different climatic conditions. To understand different climatic conditions, let us discuss the factors which cause the variations in the climate of a place or a region.

![Weather Climate](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Weather-Climate.gif?resize=480%2C256&ssl=1)

---

**Latitude or Distance from the Equator**

- The places near the equator are warmer than the places which are far away from it.
- This is because the rays of the sun fall vertical on the equator and slanting in the temperate and polar regions.
- The vertical rays are concentrated over a small area than the slanting one.
- Again, the vertical rays pass through a shorter distance in the atmosphere before reaching the earth’s surface.
- Therefore, lower the latitude higher is the temperature and vice versa.
- Malaysia which is near the equator is warmer than England which is far away from the equator.

---

**Altitude or the Height from the mean sea level**

- It is known that mountains are cooler than the plains.
- Shimla situated on a higher altitude is cooler than Jalandhar, although both are almost on the same latitude.
- The temperature decreases with the height of a place.
- For a **vertical rise of 165 metres there is an average decrease in temperature at the rate of 1°C.**
- Thus the temperature decreases with increase in height.

---

**Continentally or the Distance from the Sea**

- The water is a bad conductor of heat i.e. it takes longer time to heat and longer time to cool.
- Due to this moderating effect of the sea, places near the coast have low range of temperature and high humidity.
- The places in the interior of the continent do not experience moderating effect of the sea. These places have extreme temperatures.
- The places far from the sea have higher range of diurnal (daily) and annual temperatures.
- Mumbai has relatively lower temperature and higher rainfall than Nagpur, although both are almost situated on the same latitude.

---

**Nature of the Prevailing Winds**

- The on-shore winds bring the moisture from the sea and cause rainfall on the area through which they pass.
- The off-shore winds coming from the land are dry and help in evaporation.
- In India, the on-shore summer monsoon winds bring rains while off-shore winter monsoon winds are generally dry.

---

**Cloud Cover**

- In areas generally of cloudless sky as in deserts, temperature even under shade are very high because of the hot day time sunshine.
- At night this heat radiates back from the ground very rapidly.
- It results in a large diurnal range in temperature.
- On the other hand under cloudy sky and heavy rainfall at Thiruvananthapuram the range of temperature is very small.

---

**Ocean Currents**

- Ocean waters move from one place to another partly as an attempt to equalize temperature and density of water.
- Ocean currents are large movements of water usually from a place of warm temperature to one of cooler temperature or vice-versa.
- The warm ocean currents raise the temperature of the coast and sometimes bring rainfall, while the cold currents lower the temperature and create fog near the coast.
- **Port Bergen in Norway is free from ice** even in winter due to **warm North Atlantic Drift** while **Port Quebec in Canada remains frozen** during winter months due to **chilling effect of the Cold Labrador Current** in spite of the fact that Port Quebec is situated in much lower latitude than Port Bergen.
- The on-shore winds passing over a warm current carry warm air to the interior and raise the temperature of the inland areas.
- Similarly, the winds blowing over cold current carry cold air to the interior and create fog and mist.

---

**Direction of Mountain** **Chains**

- The mountain chains act as natural barrier for the wind.
- The on-shore moisture laden winds are forced to rise after striking against the mountain; and give heavy rainfall on the windward side.
- These winds descending on the leeward side cause very low rainfall.
- The great Himalayas check the moisture laden monsoon winds from crossing over to Tibet. This mountain chain also checks biting polar cold winds from entering into India.
- This is the reason for which northern plains of India get rains while Tibet remains a perpetual rain shadow area with lesser amount of rainfall.

---

**Slope and the Aspect**

- The concentration of heat being more on the gentler slope raises the temperature of air above them.
- Its lesser concentration along steeper slopes lowers the temperature.
- At the same time, mountain slopes facing the sun are warmer than the slopes which are away from the sun’s rays.
- The southern slopes of Himalaya are warmer than the northern slopes.

---

**The Nature of the Soil and Vegetation Cover**

- The nature of soil depends upon its texture, structure and composition. These, qualities vary from soil to soil.
- Stony or sandy soils are good conductor of heat while black clay soils absorb the heat of the sun’s rays quickly.
- The bare surface reradiates the heat easily.
- The deserts are hot in the day and cold in the night.
- The forest areas have lower range of temperature throughout the year in contrast to non-forested areas.

## Heat & Temperature

Temperature is a measure of the energy of molecules in a substance. The hotter they are the more they move.
The Earth’s surface temperature is controlled mainly by solar heating which happens from dawn to sunset.
During the typical day the surface heats and during the night it cools.
Exceptions to this happen during unusual wind events, where warm or cold air moves over the surface.
Changes in the surface temperature heat or cool the air above, which leads to air movement (wind).
The sun provides a remarkably steady flow of energy, sometimes called the solar constant by scientists, to the outer atmosphere.
This flow is absorbed, transmitted and scattered by the atmosphere below, and then the transmitted part gets reflected, absorbed or scattered.
Solar heating of the Earth’s surface is uneven because land heats faster than water, and this causes air to warm, expand and roise over land while it cools and sinks over the cooler water surface.

### Insolation

[![Heat & Temperature](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Heat-Temperature.jpg)

![Heat & Temperature](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Heat-Temperature.jpg?resize=416%2C270&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Heat-Temperature.jpg)

- It all starts with the Sun, where the fusion of hydrogen creates an immense amount of energy, **heating the surface to around 6000°K**; the Sun then radiates energy outwards in the form of ultraviolet and visible light, with a bit in the near-infrared part of the spectrum.
- By the time this energy gets out to the Earth, its intensity has dropped to a value of about **1370 W/m2** —as we just saw this is often called the solar constant (even though it is not truly constant — it changes on several timescales)
- Earth intercepts only **one in two billion parts**of solar radiation. This intercepted  radiation  is called
- Insolation is the proportion of solar energy received or intercepted by earth.
- Some heat within the core and mantle is transferred to the surface and ocean bottoms through volcanoes, springs and geysers. But this heat received at the surface form interiors of the earth is negligible compared to that received from sun.
- Earth receives Sun’s radiation (heat) in the form of **short waves** which are of electromagnetic nature.
- The earth absorbs short wave radiation during daytime and reflects back the heat received into space as **long-wave radiation** during night.
- The insolation **is not constant** over the surface of the Earth — it is concentrated near the equator because of the curvature of the Earth.
- But, the situation is complicated by the fact that the Earth’s spin axis is tilted by 23.4° relative to a line perpendicular to the Earth’s orbital plane, so that as Earth orbits around the Sun, the insolation is concentrated in the northern hemisphere (the northern hemisphere summer) and then the southern hemisphere (winter in the northern hemisphere). This tilt of the spin axis, also called the **obliquity**, is the main reason we have seasons.

### Heat Budget

- The earth receives a certain amount of Insolation **(short waves)**and gives back heat into space by terrestrial radiation **(longwave radiation).** Through this give and take, or the heat budget, the earth maintains a constant temperature.
- Earth’s energy balance is governed by the **first law of thermodynamics**, also known as the **law of conservation of energy**.
- This law states that energy can be transferred from one system to another in many forms, but it cannot be created or destroyed.
- Therefore, any energy “lost” during one process will equal the same amount of energy “gained” during another.
- The energy flows and the storage in and between each of the Earth’s subsystems involve many components.

- Each of these parts represents either **input of radiation** to the planet (**solar heating**), its output from the planet (**infrared cooling**), storage or release of heat within the climate system (evaporation, condensation, melting and freezing), or transport of heat from one part of the climate system to another (wind and ocean currents).
- Together, these processes serve as the driving forces of the climate system.
- The **total energy available to drive all climate processes comes mainly from the distribution of solar radiation arriving and leaving the Earth**.
- To maintain a constant global average temperature, all of the sun’s radiation that enters Earth’s atmosphere must eventually be sent back to space. This is achieved through **Earth’s energy balance**.

[![Heat & Temperature](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Heat-Temperature5-1024x719.jpg)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Heat-Temperature5.jpg)

- Of the total solar energy entering Earth’s atmosphere, **about 50% is absorbed by the Earth’s surface (the land and oceans), 30% is directly reflected back to space by clouds, the Earth’s surface and different gases and particles in the atmosphere and 20% is absorbed by the atmosphere and clouds**.
- The 70% of the sun’s energy that is absorbed by the surface, clouds, and atmosphere causes warming.
- Any object or gas that has a temperature emits radiation outward which is eventually reradiated back into space as long-wave radiation 24 hours a day.
- Most of the energy emitted from the earth’s surface does not go directly out to space. This emitted energy is **reabsorbed by clouds** and by the gases in the atmosphere.
- Some is **redistributed by convection**, while even more energy is released into the atmosphere through condensation.
- The majority of the energy is **absorbed by the greenhouse gases, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, carbon dioxide and water vapor**. These gases constantly emit the sun’s energy back into the atmosphere and keep the Earth at a habitable temperature. Eventually, most of the energy makes its way back out to space and Earth’s energy balance is sustained.
- As solar energy strikes the Earth, some of it is absorbed, some of it is scattered, and some of it is transmitted directly to lower levels of the atmosphere.
- **Absorption, scattering and transmission do not occur equally within the atmosphere**.
- A variety of molecules, particles or surface features absorb, transmit or scatter energy with very different energy levels, depending upon the wavelengths of the transmitted energy.
- **Molecules tend to scatter radiation**. The degree of scattering depends on the distance, the wavelength and the characteristics of the particles (size, shape, density).
- The molecules that compose the gases of the atmosphere are all very small relative to the wavelengths of most sunlight. For this reason, **shorter wavelength radiation is scattered more effectively than longer wavelengths through a process known as Rayleigh scattering.**
- The sky is blue during the day because the scattering of sunlight by the many tiny molecules of the Earth’s atmosphere favors shorter wavelengths, such as blue light.
- For the much larger particles, such as soil, dust or sulfuric acid, which make up atmospheric aerosols, the scattering efficiency is much more uniformly distributed across the visible wavelengths.
- Some of the scattering from clouds and dust results in back scattering, where a fraction of the incoming solar energy is scattered back, or reflected to space.
- **Albedo** is another name for reflectivity determines how much sunlight will be absorbed and warm the surface compared to another surface that reflects most of the light and does not change temperature.
- Something that appears white reflects most of the light that hits it and has a high albedo, while something that looks dark absorbs most of the light that hits it, indicating a low albedo.
- Gases and particles in the atmosphere allow about half of the solar rays to pass through to the Earth’s surface. However, not all of it passes directly through to the surface uninterrupted.
- Much of it – virtually all of it on a cloudy day – arrives as **diffuse radiation**, having been scattered by atmospheric particles and molecules.
- **About one third of the total of the Sun’s radiant** **energy** that reaches the Earth eventually hits the surface without being scattered and about **25% reaches the surface as diffuse radiation.**
- **At the surface, about 85% of the total amount is absorbed.**
- Over dark **a surface such as the oceans, more than 90% is absorbed.**
- In the seas or in very wet, vegetated areas this absorbed heat is used to evaporate water.
- Over bright surfaces, such as deserts and snowfields, **40-80 percent is reflected.**
- Over deserts for example, as little as 1 percent of the absorbed energy is used to evaporate water: the rest simply warms the surface.

### Distribution of Temperature

Sun is the ultimate source of heat. And the differential heat received from sun by different regions on earth is the ultimate reason behind all climatic features. So understanding the patterns of distribution of temperature in different seasons is important for understanding various climatic features like wind systems, pressure systems, precipitation etc.

---

**Horizontal Distribution of Temperature**

The distribution of temperature across latitude over the Earth’s surface is known as the horizontal distribution of temperatures. The horizontal distribution of temperature on Earth is shown by Isotherms. Isotherms are the line joining points that have an equal temperature. When the isotherm map is analyzed, it can be observed that the horizontal distribution of temperature is uneven.

**Some of the factors affecting the temperature distribution are:**

**The angle of Incidence or the Inclination of the Sun’s Rays**

[![Heat & Temperature](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Heat-Temperature6-1024x461.jpg)

**Duration of sunshine**

- Heat received depends on day or night; clear sky or overcast, summer or winter etc..

  **Transparency of Atmosphere**

- Aerosols (smoke, sooth), dust, water vopour, clouds etc. effect transparency.
- If the wavelength (X) of the radiation is more than the radius of the obstructing particle (such as a gas), then **scattering**of radiation takes place.
- If the wavelength is less than the obstructing particle (such as a dust particle), then total **reflection**takes place.
- **Absorption** of solar radiation takes place if the obstructing particles happen to be water vapour, ozone molecules, carbon dioxide molecules or clouds.

Most of the light received by earth is **scattered light.**

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Heat-Temperature7.jpg)

**Differential heating of land and water**

- Albedo of land is much greater than albedo of oceans and water bodies. Especially snow covered areas reflect up to 70%-90% of insolation.
- Average penetration of sunlight is more in water – up to 20 metres, than in land – where it is up to 1 metre only. Therefore, land cools or becomes hot more rapidly compared to oceans. In oceans, continuous convection cycle helps in heat exchange between layers keeping diurnal and annual temperature ranges low. (more while studying salinity and temperature distribution of oceans)
- The specific heat of water is 2.5 times higher than landmass, therefore water takes longer to get heated up and to cool down.

**Prevailing Winds**

- Winds transfer heat from one latitude to another. They also help in exchange of heat between land and water bodies.
- The oceanic winds have the capacity to take the moderating influence of the sea to coastal areas – reflected in cool summers and mild winters. This effect is pronounced only on the windward side (the side facing the ocean).
- The leeward side or the interiors do not get the moderating effect of the sea, and therefore experience extremes of temperature.

**Aspects of Slope**

- The direction of the slope and its angle control the amount of solar radiation received locally. Slopes more exposed to the sun receive more solar radiation than those away from the sun’s direct rays.
- Slopes that receive direct Sun’s rays are dry due to loss of moisture through excess evaporation. These slopes remain barren if irrigational facilities are absent. But slopes with good irrigational facilities are good for agriculture due to abundant sunlight available. They are occupied by dense human settlements.
- Slopes that are devoid of direct sunlight are usually well forested.

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Heat-Temperature9.jpg)

**Ocean currents**

- Ocean currents influence the temperature of adjacent land areas considerably. (more while studying ocean currents).

**Altitude**

- With increase in height, pressure falls, the effect of greenhouse gases decreases and hence temperature decreases (applicable only to troposphere).
- The normal lapse rate is roughly 1⁰ C for every 165 metres of ascent.

**Earth’s Distance from the Sun**

- During its revolution around the sun, the earth is farthest from the sun **(152 million km on 4th July)**. This position of the earth is called
- On **3rd January**, the earth is the nearest to the sun **(147 million km).**This position is called
- Therefore, the annual insolation received by the earth on 3rd January is slightly more than the amount received on 4th July.
- However, the effect of this variation in the solar output is masked by other factors like the distribution of land and sea and the atmospheric circulation.
- Hence, this variation in the solar output does not have great effect on daily weather changes on the surface of the earth.

---

**Vertical Distribution of Temperature**

- The temperature in the troposphere decreases with increase in altitudes but the rate of decrease in temperature changes according to seasons.
- The decrease of temperatures is known as vertical temperature gradient or normal lapse rate which is 1000 times more than the horizontal lapse rate.
- The decrease of temperature upward in the atmosphere proves the fact that the atmosphere gets heat from the Earth surface through the process of conduction, radiation, and convection.
- Hence, it is obvious that as the distance from the Earth’s surface (the source of direct heat energy to the atmosphere) increases (i.e as the altitude increases), the air temperature decreases.

---

**Global Distribution of Temperature**

- The global distribution of temperature can be effectively understood by considering the temperature distribution for the month of January and July.
- The distribution of temperature is usually shown on the map using the isotherms.
- The isotherms are line joining places of equal temperature.
- Generally, the effects of latitude is well shown on the map as isotherms are generally parallel to the latitudes.
- The deviation from this trend is more generally observed in January rather than in July, especially in the northern hemisphere.
- The land surface is much larger in the northern hemisphere than the southern hemisphere. Hence, the effects of land masses and ocean currents are well observed.

---

**Temperature Distribution in January**

- In January, there is winter in the Northern hemisphere and summers in the southern hemisphere.
- The western margins of continents in January are much higher than the Eastern counterparts as the westerlies can carry high temperatures into the landmasses.
- The temperature gradient is much closer to the Eastern margins of continents. The isotherms observe more steady behavior in the southern hemisphere.

---

**Temperature Distribution in July**

- During July, it is winter in the Southern hemisphere and summers in the Northern hemisphere. The isotherm behavior is the opposite of what it was in January.
- The isotherms are generally parallel to the latitudes in July.
- The equatorial oceans record warmer temperatures more than 27 degrees celsius.
- More than 30 degrees celsius is noticed over the land in the subtropical continent region of Asia, along the 30 ° N latitude.

### Temperature Inversion

- **Temperature inversion**, also called thermal inversion, a reversal of the normal behaviour of temperature in the troposphere (the region of the atmosphere nearest Earth’s surface), in which a layer of cool air at the surface is overlain by a layer of warmer air. (Under normal conditions air temperature usually decreases with height.)
- Inversions play an **important role** in determining cloud forms, precipitation, and visibility.
- An inversion acts as a cap on the upward movement of air from the layers below.
- As a result, convection produced by the heating of air from below is limited to levels below the inversion.
- Diffusion of dust, smoke, and other air pollutants is likewise limited.
- In regions where a pronounced low-level inversion is present, convective clouds cannot grow high enough to produce showers and, at the same time, visibility may be greatly reduced below the inversion, even in the absence of clouds, by the accumulation of dust and smoke particles.
- Because air near the base of an inversion tends to be cool, fog is frequently present there.
- Inversions also affect diurnal variations in air temperature.
- The principal heating of air during the day is produced by its contact with a land surface that has been heated by the Sun’s radiation.
- Heat from the ground is communicated to the air by conduction and convection.
- Since an inversion will usually control the upper level to which heat is carried by convection, only a shallow layer of air will be heated if the inversion is low and large, and the rise in temperature will be great.

---

**Ideal Conditions for Temperature Inversion**

- Long nights, so that the outgoing radiation is greater than the incoming radiation.
- Clear skies, which allow unobstructed escape of radiation.
- Calm and stable air, so that there is no vertical mixing at lower levels.

---

**Types of Temperature Inversion:**

There are five kinds of inversions: ground, turbulence, subsidence, air drainage and frontal.

**Ground Inversion:**

[![Heat & Temperature](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Heat-Temperature10.jpg)

![Heat & Temperature](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Heat-Temperature10.jpg?resize=355%2C320&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Heat-Temperature10.jpg)

- A ground inversion develops when air is cooled by contact with a colder surface until it becomes cooler than the overlying atmosphere; this occurs most often on clear nights, when the ground cools off rapidly by radiation.
- If the temperature of surface air drops below its dew point, fog may result.
- Topography greatly affects the magnitude of ground inversions.
- If the land is rolling or hilly, the cold air formed on the higher land surfaces tends to drain into the hollows, producing a larger and thicker inversion above low ground and little or none above higher elevations.

**Turbulence Inversion**

- A turbulence inversion often forms when quiescent air overlies turbulent air.
- Within the turbulent layer, vertical mixing carries heat downward and cools the upper part of the layer.
- The unmixed air above is not cooled and eventually is warmer than the air below; an inversion then exists.

**Subsidence Inversion:**

- A subsidence inversion develops when a widespread layer of air descends.
- The layer is compressed and heated by the resulting increase in atmospheric pressure, and, as a result, the lapse rate of temperature is reduced.
- If the air mass sinks low enough, the air at higher altitudes becomes warmer than at lower altitudes, producing a temperature inversion.
- Subsidence inversions are common over the northern continents in winter and over the subtropical oceans; these regions generally have subsiding air because they are located under large high-pressure centres.

**Air drainage type of Inversion**

[![Heat & Temperature](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Inclusive-growth-and-issues-arising-from-it-1.jpg)

![Heat & Temperature](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Inclusive-growth-and-issues-arising-from-it-1.jpg?resize=354%2C142&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Inclusive-growth-and-issues-arising-from-it-1.jpg)

- Sometimes, the temperature in the lower layers of air increases instead of decreasing with elevation. This happens **commonly along a sloping surface.**
- Here, the surface radiates heat back to space rapidly and cools down at a faster rate than the upper layers. As a result the lower cold layers get condensed and become heavy.
- The sloping surface underneath makes them move towards the bottom where the cold layer settles down as a zone of low temperature while the upper layers are relatively warmer.
- This condition, opposite to normal vertical distribution of temperature, is known as Temperature Inversion.
- In other words, the vertical temperature gets inverted during temperature inversion.
- This kind of temperature inversion is very strong in the middle and higher latitudes. It can be strong in regions with high mountains or deep valleys also.

**Frontal Inversion**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Heat-Temperature12.jpg)

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Heat-Temperature12.jpg?resize=345%2C191&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Heat-Temperature12.jpg)

- A frontal inversion occurs when a cold air mass undercuts a warm air mass and lifts it aloft; the front between the two air masses then has warm air above and cold air below.
- This kind of inversion has a considerable slope, whereas other inversions are nearly horizontal. In addition, humidity may be high, and clouds may be present immediately above it.

---

**Economic Importance of Temperature Inversion:**

- Sometimes, the temperature of the air at the valley bottom reaches below freezing point, whereas the air at higher altitude remains comparatively warm. As a result, the trees along the lower slopes are bitten by frost, whereas those at higher levels are free from it.
- Due to inversion of temperature, air pollutants such as dust particles and smoke do not disperse in the valley bottoms. Because of these factors, houses and farms in intermontane valleys are usually situated along the upper slopes, avoiding the cold and foggy valley bottoms. For instance, coffee growers of Brazil and apple growers and hoteliers of mountain states of Himalayas in India avoid lower slopes.
- Fog lowers visibility affecting vegetation and human settlements.
- Less rainfall due to stable conditions.

## Pressure and Pressure belts

### Atmospheric Pressure

- Air pressure is an essential element of weather, especially when it comes to creating or changing atmospheric conditions.
- It is also one of the critical variables used to make accurate weather forecasts.
- Air Pressure is the result of the **pressure created by the weight of the air** in the Earth’s atmosphere.
- It is also called a **barometric pressure**, named after the instrument used to measure air pressure.
- Although it may not be visible, air has weight since it is not empty. It is filled with small particles of nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide and a few other gases.
- The weight of the particles in the air creates pressure due to the gravitational force of the Earth.
- Since more air is present above the air close to the ground, air pressure is the highest on the planet’s surface and decreases as altitude increase.
- The **barometer is the instrument** used to measure air pressure.

### Measurement of Air Pressure

- The atmosphere is held on the earth by the gravitational pull of the earth.
- A column of air exerts weight in terms of pressure on the surface of the earth.
- The **weight of the column of air** at a given place and time is called air pressure or atmospheric pressure.
- Atmospheric pressure is measured by an instrument **called barometer.**
- Nowadays **Fortin’s barometer** and **Aneroid barometer** are commonly used for measuring air pressure.
- Atmospheric pressure is measured as **force per unit area**.
- The unit used for measuring pressure is called **millibar**. Its abbreviation is ‘**mb’.**
- One millibar is equal to the force of one gram per square centimetre approximately.
- A pressure of 1000 millibars is equal to the **weight of 1.053 kilograms per square centimetre at sea level.**
- It is equal to the weight of a column of **mercury which is 76 centimetre high.**
- The international standard pressure unit is the “**pascal**”, a force of one Newton per square meter. In practice atmospheric pressure is expressed in kilopascals, (one kpa equals 1000 Pa).
- The **mean atmospheric pressure at sea level is 1013.25 millibars**. However the actual pressure at a given place and at a given time fluctuates and it generally ranges between 950 and 1050 millibars.

### Distribution of Pressure

Distribution of atmospheric pressure on the surface of the earth is not uniform. It varies both vertically and horizontally.

#### Vertical Distribution

![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pressure-and-Pressure-belts.png)

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pressure-and-Pressure-belts.png?resize=525%2C319&ssl=1)

- Air is a mixture of various gases.
- It is highly compressible. As it compresses, its density increases.
- The higher the density of air, the greater is the air pressure and vice versa.
- The mass of air above in the column of air compresses the air under it hence its lower layers are more dense than the upper layers. As a result, the **lower layers** of the atmosphere have higher density, hence, **exert more pressure**.
- Conversely, the higher layers are less compressed and, hence, they have low density and low pressure.
- The **columnar distribution** of atmospheric pressure is known as vertical distribution of pressure.
- Air pressure decreases with increase in altitude but it does not always decrease at the same rate.
- Dense components of atmosphere are found in its lowest parts near the mean sea level.
- Temperature of the air, amount of water vapour present in the air and gravitational pull of the earth determine the air pressure of a given place and at a given time.
- Since these factors are variable with change in height, there is a variation in the rate of decrease in air pressure with increase in altitude.
- The **normal rate of decrease in air pressure is 34 millibars per every 300 metres** increase in altitude.
- The effects of low pressure are more clearly experienced by the people living in the hilly areas as compared to those who live in plains.
- In high mountainous areas rice takes more time to cook because low pressure reduces the boiling point of water.
- Breathing problem such as faintness and nose bleedings are also faced by many trekkers from outside in such areas because of low pressure conditions in which the air is thin and it has low amount of oxygen content.

#### Horizontal Distribution

- The distribution of atmospheric pressure over the globe is known as horizontal distribution of pressure.
- It is shown on maps with the help of
- An isobar is a **line connecting points that have equal values of pressure**.
- Isobars are analogous to the contour lines on a relief map.
- The spacing of isobars expresses the rate and direction of change in air pressure.
- This change in air pressure is referred to pressure gradient.
- **Pressure gradient** is the ratio between pressure difference and the actual horizontal distance between two points.
- Close spacing of isobars expresses steep pressure gradient while wide spacing indicates gentle pressure gradient.
- **The horizontal distribution of atmospheric pressure is not uniform in the world**. It varies from time to time at a given place; it varies from place to place over short distances.
- **The factors responsible for variation in the horizontal distribution** **of pressure** are as follows:
- (i) Air temperature
- (ii) The earth’s rotation
- (iii) Presence of water vapour

**(i) Air Temperature:**

- - The earth is not heated uniformly because of unequal distribution of insolation, differential heating and cooling of land and water surfaces.
  - Generally there is an **inverse relationship between air temperature and air pressure.**
  - The higher the air temperature, the lower is the air pressure.
  - The fundamental rule about gases is that when they are heated, they become less dense and expand in volume and rise. Hence, air pressure is low in equatorial regions and it is higher in polar regions.
  - Along the equator lies a belt of low pressure known as the **“equatorial low or doldrums”**.
  - Low air pressure in equatorial regions is due to the fact that hot air ascends there with gradual decrease in temperature causing thinness of air on the surface.
  - In polar region, cold air is very dense hence it descends and pressure increases. From this one might expect, a gradual increase in average temperature and a gradual decrease in pressure towards the equator.
  - However, actual readings taken on the earth’s surface at different places indicate that pressure does not increase latitudinally in a regular fashion from equator to the poles.
  - Instead, there are regions of high pressure in subtropics and regions of low pressure in the subpolar areas.

**(ii) The Earth’s Rotation:**

- - The earth’s rotation generates centrifugal force.
  - This results in the deflection of air from its original place, causing decrease of pressure.
  - It is believed that the low pressure belts of the sub polar regions and the high pressure belts of the sub-tropical regions are created as a result of the earth’s rotation.
  - The earth’s rotation also causes convergence and divergence of moving air.
  - Areas of convergence experience low pressure while those of divergence have high pressure.

**(iii) Pressure of Water Vapour :**

- - Air with higher quantity of water vapour has lower pressure and that with lower quantity of water vapour has higher pressure.
  - In winter the continents are relatively cool and tend to develop high pressure centres; in summer they stay warmer than the oceans and tend to be dominated by low pressure, conversely, the oceans are associated with low pressure in winter and high pressure in summer.

#### Seasonal Distribution of Pressure

- The variation of pressure from place to place and from season to season over the earth plays an important role in affecting the weather and climate.
- Therefore pressure distribution is studied through isobar maps.
- While drawing isobar maps, the pressures of all places are reduced to sea level to avoid the effect of altitude on air pressure.

**(i) January Conditions**

- In January, with the south-ward apparent movement of the Sun, the equatorial low pressure belt shifts a little south of the mean equatorial position (see fig.).
- Areas of lowest pressure occurs in South America, Southern Africa and Australia.
- This is because the land tends to get hotter rapidly than water.
- Sub-tropical high pressure cells are centered over the ocean in the southern hemisphere.
- The belt of high pressure is interrupted by the continental land masses where the temperature is much higher.
- They are well developed in eastern part of the ocean where cold ocean currents dominate.

![Pressure and Pressure belts](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pressure-and-Pressure-belts2.png)

![Pressure and Pressure belts](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pressure-and-Pressure-belts2.png?resize=525%2C305&ssl=1)

- The Aleutian and Icelandic lows disappear from the oceans while the landmasses, which developed high pressure during winter months, have extensive low pressure cells now.
- In Asia, a low pressure develops. The subtropical highs of the northern hemisphere are more developed over the oceans – Pacific and Atlantic.
- In the southern hemisphere, the sub-tropical high pressure belt is continuous.
- Sub-polar low forms a continuous belt in the southern hemisphere while in northern hemisphere, there is only a faint oceanic low

### Pressure Belts

- The horizontal distribution of air pressure across the latitudes is characterized by high or low pressure belts.
- This is however, a theoretical model because pressure belts are not always found as such on the earth.
- These pressure belts are:

(i) The Equatorial Low Pressure Belt;

(ii) The Sub tropic High Pressure Belts;

(iii) The Sub-polar Low Pressure Betts;

(iv) The Polar High Pressure Belts

![Pressure and Pressure belts](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pressure-and-Pressure-belts3.png)

![Pressure and Pressure belts](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pressure-and-Pressure-belts3.png?resize=525%2C479&ssl=1)

**(i) The Equatorial Low Pressure Belt**

- The sun shines almost vertically on the equator throughout the year.
- As a result the air gets warm and rises over the equatorial region and produce equatorial low pressure.
- This belt extends from equator to 10º N and 10 º S latitudes.
- Due to excessive heating horizontal movement of air is absent here and only conventional currents are there.
- Therefore this belt is called **doldrums (the zone of calm)** due to virtual absence of surface winds.
- These are the regions of convergence because the winds flowing from sub tropical high pressure belts converge here.
- This belt is also known as-**Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ**).

**(ii) The Sub-tropical High Pressure Belts**

- The sub-tropical high pressure belts extend from the tropics to about 35 º latitudes in both the Hemispheres.
- In the northern hemisphere it is called as the North sub-tropical high pressure belt and in the southern hemisphere it is known as the South sub-tropical high pressure belt.
- The existence of these pressure belts is due to the fact that the up rising air of the equatorial region is deflected towards poles due to the earth’s rotation.
- After becoming cold and heavy, it descends in these regions and get piled up. This results in **high pressure**.
- Calm conditions with feeble and variable winds are found here.
- In olden days vessels with cargo of horses passing through these belts found difficulty in sailing under these calm conditions.
- They used to throw the horses in the sea in order to make the vessels lighter. Henceforth these belts or latitudes are also called **‘horse latitudes’**.
- These are the regions of divergence because winds from these areas blow towards equatorial and subpolar low pressure belts.

**(iii) The Sub-polar low Pressure Belts**

- The sub-polar low pressure belts extend between 45 º N and the Arctic Circle in the northern hemisphere and between 45°S and the Antarctic Circle in the southern hemisphere.
- They are known as the North sub-polar low and the South sub-polar low pressure belts respectively.
- Winds coming from the sub-tropical and the polar high belts converge here to produce cyclonic storms or low pressure conditions.
- This zone of convergence is also known as polar front.

**(iv)  The Polar High Pressure Belts**

- In polar regions, sun never shines vertically.
- Sun rays are always slanting here resulting in low temperatures.
- Because of low temperature, air compresses and its density increases. Hence, high pressure is found here.
- In northern hemisphere the belt is called the North polar high pressure belt while it is known as the South polar high pressure belt in the southern hemisphere.
- Winds from these belts blow towards sub-polar low pressure belts.

**Shifting of Pressure belts**

- This system of pressure belts is a generalised picture.
- In reality, the location of these pressure belts is not permanent.
- They shift northward in July and southward in January, following the changing position of the sun’s direct rays as they migrate between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.
- The thermal equator (commonly known as the belt of highest temperature) also shifts northwards and southwards of the equator.
- With the shifting of thermal equator northwards in summer and southwards in winter, there is also a slight shift in pressure belts towards north and south of their annual average location.

## Winds

Air pressure is unevenly distributed.
Air attempts to balance the uneven distribution of pressure.
Hence, it moves from high pressure areas to low pressure areas.
Horizontal movement of air in response to difference in pressure is termed as wind while vertical or nearly vertical moving air is called air current.
Both winds and air currents form the system of circulation in the atmosphere.

### Forces Controlling Winds

**Pressure Gradient and Winds**

- There is a close relationship between the pressure and the wind speed.
- The greater the difference in air pressure between the two points, the steeper is the pressure gradient and greater is the speed of the wind.
- The gentler the pressure gradient slower is the speed of the wind. (see fig).

**The Coriolis Effect and Wind**

- Winds do not cross the isobars at right angles as the pressure gradient directs them.
- They get deflected from their original paths.
- One of the most potent influences on wind direction is the deflection caused by the earth’s rotation on its axis.
- Demonstrated by **Gaspaved de Coriolis in 1844** and known as the Coriolis effect or coriolis force.
- Coriolis force tend to deflect the winds from their original direction.
- In northern hemisphere winds are deflected towards their right, and in the southern hemisphere towards their left (see fig.) This is known as **Ferrel’s law**.
- The Coriolis force is absent along the equator but increases progressively towards the poles.

### Types of Winds

For ages man has observed that in some areas of the earth the winds blow predominantly from one direction throughout the year; in other areas the wind direction changes with the season and in still others the winds are so variable that no pattern is discernible. Despite these difference, the winds are generalized under three categories.

- (a) Planetary winds or permanent winds
- (b) Periodic winds or Seasonal winds
- (c) Local winds

## Precipitation-forms & Types, Distribution Of Rainfall

Precipitation occurs when tiny droplets of water, ice or frozen water vapor join together into masses too big to be held above the earth. They then fall to ground as precipitation.

The term precipitation denotes all forms of water that reach the earth from the atmosphere. Usual forms are rainfall, snowfall, hail, frost and dew. Of all these, only the first two contribute significant amounts of water. Magnitude of precipitation varies with time and space.

Conditions for precipitation to form:

The atmosphere must have moisture.
There must be sufficient nuclei present to aid condensation.
Weather conditions must be good for condensation of water vapour to take place.
The products of condensation must reach the earth.

### Process of precipitation

- Precipitation is water in liquid or solid forms, falling to the earth.
- It always precedes condensation or sublimation or a combination of the two and is primarily associated with raising air.
- In the same way that isotherms and isobars are used to show temperature and pressure distribution respectively, isohyets indicate rainfall distribution.
- An **isohyet** is a line connecting points with equal values of rainfall.
- Change of state from water vapour to liquid water is
- When moist air comes in contact with cool surfaces, it may be cooled to the point where its capacity to hold water vapour is exceeded by the actual amount in the air.
- Part of the water vapour then condenses into liquid form on the cool surface, produce dew.
- When this happens, the **latent heat of vaporisation, in this process, called the latent heat of condensation** is released.
- At temperatures below freezing, water may bypass the liquid form in its change of state.
- When dry air with a temperature well below freezing comes in contact with ice, molecules of ice (H2O) pass directly into the vapour state by the processes of sublimation.
- Under proper weather conditions, water vapour condenses over nuclei to form tiny water droplets of sizes less than 0.1 mm in dia.
- The nuclei are usually salt particles or products of combustion and are normally available in plenty.
- Wind speed facilitates movement of clouds while its turbulence retains water droplets in suspension.
- Precipitation results when water droplets come together and coalesce to form larger drops that can drop down.
- Considerable part of this precipitation gets evaporated back to the atmosphere.

### Different forms of Precipitation

**Rain**

- Rain is any liquid that drops from the clouds in the sky.
- Rain is described as water droplets of 0.5 mm or larger.
- Droplets less than half a millimeter are defined as a **drizzle**.
- Raindrops frequently fall when small cloud particles strike and bind together, creating bigger drops.
- As this process continues, the drops get bigger and bigger to an extent where they become too heavy to suspend on the air.
- As a result, the gravity pulls then down to the earth.
- When high in the air, the raindrops start falling as ice crystals or snow but melt when as they proceed down the earth through the warmer air.
- Rainfall rates vary from time to time, for example, light rain ranges from rates of 0.01 to 0.1 inches per hour, moderate rain from 0.1 to .3 inches per hour, and heavy rain above 0.3 inches per hour.
- Rain is the most common component of the water cycleand replenishes most of the freshwater on the earth.

**Snow**

- Snow occurs almost every time there is rain.
- However, snow often melts before it reaches the earth’s surface.
- It is precipitation in the form of virga or flakes of ice water falling from the clouds.
- Snow is normally seen together with high, thin, and weak cirrus clouds.
- Snow can at times fall when the atmospheric temperatures are above freezing, but it mostly occurs in sub-freezing air.
- When the temperatures are above freezing, the snowflakes can partially melt but because of relatively warm temperatures, the evaporation of the particles occurs almost immediately.
- This evaporation leads to cooling just around the snowflake and makes it to reach to the ground as snow.
- Snow has a fluffy, white, and soft structure and its formation is in different shapes and ways, namely flat plates, and thin needles.
- Each type of snow forms under specific combinations of atmospheric humidity and temperatures. The process of snow precipitation is called

**Sleet (Ice Pellets)**

- Sleet takes place in freezing atmospheric conditions.
- Sleet, also known as ice pellets, form when snow falls into a warm layer then melts into the rain and then the rain droplets fall into a freezing layer of air that is cold enough to refreeze the raindrops into ice pellets.
- Hence, sleet is defined as a form of precipitation composed of small and semitransparent balls of ice.
- They should not be confused with hailstones as they are smaller in size.
- Sleet is often experienced during thunderstorms and is normally accompanied by frosty ice crystals that form white deposits and a mixture of semisolid rain and slushy snow.
- Ice pellets (sleet) bounce when they hit the ground or any other solid objects and fall with a hard striking sound.
- Sleet don does not freeze into a solid mass except when it combines with freezing rain.

**Freezing Rain**

- Freezing rain happens when rain falls during below freezing conditions/temperatures. This normally results in the solidification of rain droplets.
- The raindrops are super-cooled while passing through the sub-freezing layer in the atmosphere and freezes by the time it reaches the ground.
- During freezing rains, it is common to witness an even coating of ice on cars, streets, trees, and power lines.
- The resulting coating of ice is called **glaze** and it can build up to a thickness of several centimeters.
- Freezing rains pose a huge threat to normal operations of roadway transportation, aircraft, and power lines.

**Hail**

- Hailstones are big balls and irregular lumps of ice that fall from large thunderstorms.
- Hail is purely solid precipitation.
- As opposed to sleets that can form in any weather when there are thunderstorms, hailstones are predominately experienced in the winter or cold weather.
- Hailstones are mostly made up of water ice and measure between 0.2 inches (5 millimeters) and 6 inches (15 centimeters) in diameter.
- This ranges in size of a pea’s diameter to that larger than a grapefruit.
- For this reason, they are highly damaging to crops, tearing leaves apart and reducing their value.
- Violent thunderstorms with very strong updrafts usually have the capability to hold ice against the gravitational pull, which brings about the hailstones when they eventually escape and fall to the ground.
- So, hailstones are formed from super-cooled droplets that slowly freeze and result in a sheet of clear ice.

**Drizzle**

- Drizzle is very light rain. It is stronger than mist but less than a shower.
- Mist is a thin fog with condensation near the ground.
- Fog is made up of ice crystals or cloud water droplets suspended in the air near or at the earth’s surface.
- Drizzle droplets are smaller than 0.5 millimeters (0.02 inches) in diameter.
- They arise from low stratocumulus clouds.
- They sometimes evaporate even before reaching the ground due to their minute size.
- Drizzle can be persistent is cold atmospheric temperatures.

**Sun Shower**

- Sun shower is a precipitation event that is registered when rain falls while the sun shines.
- It occurs when the winds bearing rain together with rainstorms are blown several miles away, thus giving rise to raindrops into an area without clouds.
- Consequently, a sun shower is formed when a single rain cloud passes above the earth’s surface and the sun’s rays penetrate through the raindrops.
- Most of the time, it is accompanied by the appearance of a rainbow.

**Snow Grains**

- Snow grains are very small white and opaque grains of ice.
- Snow grains are fairly flat and have a diameter generally less than 1mm.
- They are almost equivalent to the size of drizzle.

**Diamond Dust**

- Diamond dust is extremely small ice crystals usually formed at low levels and at temperatures below -30 °C.
- Diamond dust got its name from the sparkling effect which is created when light reflects on the ice crystals in the air.

### Types of Precipitation

On the basis of origin, rainfall may be classified into three main types – the convectional, orographic or relief and the cyclonic or frontal.

#### Convectional Rainfall

\*\*![Precipitation](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precipitation.gif)

![Precipitation](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precipitation.gif?resize=400%2C300&ssl=1)

\*\*

- The, air on being heated, becomes light and rises up in convection currents. As it rises, it expands and loses heat and consequently, condensation takes place and cumulous clouds are formed. This process releases latent heat of condensation which further heats the air and forces the air to go further up.
- Convectional precipitation is heavy but of short duration, highly localised and is associated with minimum amount of cloudiness. It occurs mainly during summer and is common over equatorial doldrums in the Congo basin, the Amazon basin and the islands of south-east Asia.

#### Orographic Rainfall

\*\*  
![Precipitation](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precipitation3.png)

![Precipitation](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precipitation3.png?resize=525%2C366&ssl=1)

\*\*

- When the saturated air mass comes across a mountain, it is forced to ascend and as it rises, it expands (because of fall in pressure); the temperature falls, and the moisture is condensed.
- This type of precipitation occurs when warm, humid air strikes an orographic barrier (a mountain range) head on. Because of the initial momentum, the air is forced to rise. As the moisture laden air gains height, condensation sets in, and soon saturation is reached. The surplus moisture falls down as orographic precipitation along the windward slopes.
- The chief characteristic of this sort of rain is that the **windward slopes**receive greater rainfall. After giving rain on the windward side, when these winds reach the other slope, they descend, and their temperature rises. Then their capacity to take in moisture increases and hence, these **leeward slopes** remain rainless and dry. The area situated on the leeward side, which gets less rainfall is known as the **rain-shadow area** (Some arid and semi-arid regions are a direct consequence of rain-shadow effect. Example: **Patagonian desert in Argentina, Eastern slopes of Western Ghats**). It is also known as the **relief rain.**
- Example: Mahabaleshwar, situated on the Western Ghats, receives more than 600 cm of rainfall, whereas Pune, lying in the rain shadow area, has only about 70 cm.
- The Wind Descending on the Leeward Side is heated adiabatically and is called **Katabatic Wind.**

#### Frontal Precipitation

![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precipitation4.png)

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precipitation4.png?resize=467%2C256&ssl=1)

- This type of rainfall occurs along the zone of contact between a warm and cool air mass.
- When two large air masses of different temperature meet, the warmer and hence lighter air is lifted above the cooler air.
- Warm air then rises, cools and condenses to form rain.
- The boundary that separates cold air and warm air is called a front.

### Distribution of Rainfall

![Precipitation](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precipitation5.png)

![Precipitation](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precipitation5.png?resize=500%2C220&ssl=1)

- Different places on the earth’s surface receive different amounts of rainfall in a year and that too in different seasons. In general, as we proceed from the equator towards the poles, rainfall goes on decreasing steadily.
- The coastal areas of the world receive greater amounts of rainfall than the interior of the continents. The rainfall is more over the oceans than on the landmasses of the world because of being great sources of water.
- Between the latitudes 35° and 40° N and S of the equator, the rain is heavier on the eastern coasts and goes on decreasing towards the west. But, between 45° and 65° N and S of equator, due to the **westerlies**, the rainfall is first received on the western margins of the continents and it goes on decreasing towards the east.
- Wherever mountains run parallel to the coast, the rain is greater on the coastal plain, on the windward side and it decreases towards the leeward side.
- On the basis of the total amount of annual precipitation, major precipitation regimes of the world are identified as follows.
- The equatorial belt, the windward slopes of the mountains along the western coasts in the cool temperate zone and the coastal areas of the monsoon land receive heavy rainfall of over 200 cm per annum.
- Interior continental areas receive moderate rainfall varying from 100 – 200 cm per annum. The coastal areas of the continents receive moderate amount of rainfall.
- The central parts of the tropical land and the eastern and interior parts of the temperate lands receive rainfall varying between 50 – 100 cm per annum.
- Areas lying in the **rain shadow zone**of the interior of the continents and high latitudes receive very low rainfall – less than 50 cm per annum.
- Seasonal distribution of rainfall provides an important aspect to judge its effectiveness. In some regions rainfall is distributed evenly throughout the year such as in the equatorial belt and in the western parts of cool temperate regions.

## Air Masses

Air mass, in meteorology, is a large body of air having nearly uniform conditions of temperature and humidity at any given level of altitude.
Such a mass has distinct boundaries and may extend hundreds or thousands of kilometres horizontally and sometimes as high as the top of the troposphere (about 10–18 km [6–11 miles] above the Earth’s surface).
An air mass forms whenever the atmosphere remains in contact with a large, relatively uniform land or sea surface for a time sufficiently long to acquire the temperature and moisture properties of that surface.
The Earth’s major air masses originate in polar or subtropical latitudes.
The middle latitudes constitute essentially a zone of modification, interaction, and mixing of the polar and tropical air masses.

### Source Regions

- The homogenous surfaces, over which air masses form, are called the **source regions.**
- The main source regions are the **high pressure belts**in the **sub tropics (giving rise to tropical air masses)** and around the **poles (the source for polar air masses).**
- Source Region establishes **heat and moisture equilibrium** with the overlying air mass.
- When an air mass moves away from a source region, the upper level maintains the physical characteristics for a longer period. This is possible because air masses are stable with stagnant air which **do not facilitate convection**. Conduction and radiation in such stagnant air is not effective.

### Conditions for Formation of Air Masses

- Source region should be extensive with **gentle, divergent air circulation**(slightly at high pressure).
- Areas with **high pressure but little pressure difference**or pressure gradient are ideal source regions.
- **_There are no major source regions in the mid-latitudes as these regions are dominated by cyclonic and other disturbances._**

### Air Mass Formation and Processes

- Where an air mass receives it’s characteristics of temperature and humidity is called the **source region.**
- Air masses are slowly pushed along by high-level winds, when an air mass moves over a new region, it shares its temperature and humidity with that region.
- So the temperature and humidity of a particular location depends partly on the characteristics of the air mass that sits over it.
- Storms arise if the air mass and the region it moves over have different characteristics.
- For example, when a colder air mass moves over warmer ground, the bottom layer of air is heated. That air rises, forming clouds, rain, and sometimes thunderstorms.
- When a warmer air mass travels over colder ground, the bottom layer of air cools and, because of its high density, is trapped near the ground.
- In general, cold air masses tend to flow toward the equator and warm air masses tend to flow toward the poles.
- This brings heat to cold areas and cools down areas that are warm.
- It is one of the many processes that act towards balancing out the planet’s temperatures.
- Air masses are slowly pushed along by high-level winds.
- When an air mass moves over a new region, it shares its temperature and humidity with that region.
- So the temperature and humidity of a particular location depends partly on the characteristics of the air mass that sits over it.

### Classification of Air Masses

Air masses are classified based on their temperature and humidity characteristics. Broadly, the air masses are classified into polar and tropical air masses.

Both the polar and the continental air masses can be either of maritime or continental types.

The principal source regions of the earth may be classified according to the nature of the surface (land or water) and latitude of the region.

[![Classification of Air Masses](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Air-Masses1-300x145.jpg)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Air-Masses1.jpg)

**Thus the source regions are classified as under:**

- Surface
- Continental
- Maritime
- Latitude
- Arctic (located in the high latitudes)
- Polar (between Arctic source regions and subtropical highs)
- Tropical (occupy subtropical high pressure belts)
- Equatorial (located around the equator between the trade winds of the northern and southern hemispheres)

**The air masses may be classified as under**:

---

**Polar**

- - **Continental Polar airmass (winter time) cPK**
    - **Source regions**: Central Canada and Siberia.
    - Extremely cold, dry, stable airmass (coldest wintertime airmasses)
    - Produce intense cold waves
    - No clouds in these air masses.
  - **Continental Polar airmass (summer time) cPW**
    - **Source regions:** Central parts of high latitude continents. Example Central Canada
    - Cool and dry airmasses
    - Steep lapse rates.
    - When cPK moves out to oceanic surface, it is modified into cPW air mass with haze, fog and low stratus clouds.
  - **Maritime Polar airmass (winter time) mPK**
    - mPK forms over open areas in the higher latitudes cool and moist few clouds in their source regions
    - Extensive precipitation is produced when forced to ascend mountain barriers
    - Lower layers moist and unstable and dry and cool in upper parts.
    - Produce squally weather.
  - **Maritime Polar airmass (summer time) mPW**
    - Cool and moist in the lower parts, but dry aloft
    - Temperature inversion is produced with moisture discontinuity Temperature slightly higher

---

**Tropical**

- **Continental Tropical air mass**
  - **Source regions**: Subtropical high pressure land areas
  - High temperature and low moisture content.
  - In United States, these air masses are only important in summer. They are both dry in winter and summer.
  - In summer they are very hot
  - Subsidence and stability found in the upper parts of these air masses in their source regions.
  - If cT air mass is aloft over warm moist air at the surface, atmosphere becomes convectively unstable and violent thunderstorms and tornadoes are produced.
  - **Maritime Tropical air mass mT**
  - Warm and moist and highly unstable having convective unstability.
  - **Maritime Tropical air mass (winter time)**
    - **Source regions:** Warm oceans in both the hemisphere Warm moist and unstable air masses
    - Steep lapse rate up to tropopause and moisture well distributed up to high levels.
    - When these air masses are lifted over fronts or high mountains, they produce heavy Precipitation
  - **Maritime Tropical air mass (summer time)**
    - **Source regions** located in the belt of great semi permanent highs of the tropical oceans including the Caribbean Sea.

### Effect of Air Masses on World Weather

- The properties of an air mass which influence the accompanying weather are **vertical distribution temperature**(indicating its stability and coldness or warmness) and the **moisture content.**
- The air masses carry atmospheric moisture from oceans to continents and cause **precipitation**over landmasses.
- They transport **latent heat**, thus removing the latitudinal heat balance.
- Most of the migratory atmospheric disturbances such as cyclones and storms originate at the **contact zone**between different air masses and the weather associated with these disturbances is determined by characteristics of the air masses involved.

## Cyclones and Anticyclones

In meteorology, the term ‘cyclone’ can be defined as the rapid inward circulation of air masses around a low-pressure centre which is circling counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern. Cyclonic rotation is associated with low-pressure systems, so that cyclone and low can be used interchangeably.

### Types of Cyclones

Depending on the type of prevailing low-pressure system, cyclones are categorized into two types:

#### Extratropical Cyclones

Extratropical cyclones are also called wave cyclone or mid-latitude cyclone or temperate cyclones. The systems developing in the mid and high latitude, beyond the tropics are called the middle latitude or extra tropical cyclones.

To understand and formation of cyclone formation, we have to understand several terms related to it.

**Cyclogenesis**

It is an umbrella term to identify several different processes that result in a cyclone.

**Air Masses**

When the air remains over a homogenous area for a sufficiently longer time, it acquires the characteristics of the area. The homogenous regions can be the vast ocean surface or vast plains. The air with distinctive characteristics in terms of temperature and humidity is called an air mass.

It is defined as a large body of air having little horizontal variation in temperature and moisture. The homogenous surfaces, over which air masses form, are called the source regions.

The air masses are classified according to the source regions. There are five major source regions. These are:

- Warm tropical and subtropical oceans;
- The subtropical hot deserts;
- The relatively cold high latitude oceans;
- The very cold snow covered continents in high latitudes;
- Permanently ice covered continents in the Arctic and Antarctica.

**Fronts**

When two different air masses meet, the boundary zone between them is called a front. The process of formation of the fronts is known as frontogenesis. There are four types of fronts:

- **Stationary**: When the front remains stationary, it is called a stationary front.
- **Warm**: When the warm air mass moves towards the cold air mass, the contact zone is a warm front.
- **Cold**: When the cold air moves towards the warm air mass, its contact zone is called the cold front
- **Occluded**: When an air mass is fully lifted above the land surface, it is called the occluded front.

[![Cyclones and Anticyclones](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Extra-Tropical-Cyclones-222x300.jpg)

![Cyclones and Anticyclones](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Extra-Tropical-Cyclones.jpg?resize=222%2C300&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Extra-Tropical-Cyclones.jpg)

The fronts occur in middle latitudes and are characterized by steep gradient in temperature and pressure. They bring abrupt changes in temperature and cause the air to rise to form clouds and cause precipitation.

**Formation of Extratropical Cyclones**

- Extratropical cyclones form along the polar front.
- Initially, the front is stationary.
- In the northern hemisphere, warm air blows from the south and cold air from the north of the front.
- When the pressure drops along the front, the warm air moves northwards and the cold air move towards south, causing an anticlockwise cyclonic circulation.
- The cyclonic circulation leads to a well-developed extra tropical cyclone, with a warm front and a cold front.
- The plan and cross section of a well-developed cyclone is given in Figure 2.
- The warm air glides over the cold air and a sequence of clouds appear over the sky ahead of the warm front and cause precipitation.
- The cold front approaches the warm air from behind and pushes the warm air up.
- As a result, cumulus clouds develop along the cold front.
- The cold front moves faster than the warm front ultimately overtaking the warm front.
- The warm air is completely lifted up and the front is occluded and the cyclone dissipates.

#### Tropical Cyclone

- Tropical cyclones are violent storms that originate over oceans in tropical areas and move over to the coastal areas.
- It brings large-scale destruction caused by violent winds, very heavy rainfall and storm surges.
- The winds blow counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.

**Terminology**

[![Tropical cyclones](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Extra-Tropical-Cyclones2-300x233.jpg)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Extra-Tropical-Cyclones2.jpg)

It varies location to location. They are known as

- Cyclones in the Indian Ocean
- Hurricanes in the Atlantic
- Typhoons in the Western Pacific and South China Sea, and,
- Willy-willies in the Western Australia.

**Naming Of Cyclones**

- Adopting names for cyclones makes it easier for people to remember, as opposed to numbers and technical terms.
- Cyclones that form in every ocean basin across the world are named by the regional specialized meteorological centers (RSMCs) and Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres (TCWCs).
- There are six RSMCs in the world, including the India Meteorological Department (IMD), and five TCWCs.
- The IMD is mandated to naming of cyclones as well as issuing advisories to 13 countries in the region on the development of cyclones and storms, namely Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Iran, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen.

**Conditions favorable for the formation**

- Large sea surface with temperature higher than 27° C;
- Presence of the Coriolis force;
- Small variations in the vertical wind speed;
- pre-existing weak low-pressure area or low-level-cyclonic circulation;
- Upper divergence above the sea level system.

- The energy that intensifies the storm comes from the condensation process in the towering cumulonimbus clouds, surrounding the centre of the storm.
- With continuous supply of moisture from the sea, the storm is further strengthened. The more time they spend over the seas, the stronger they become.
- On reaching the land the moisture supply is cut off and the storm dissipates. The place where a tropical cyclone crosses the coast is called the **landfall** of the cyclone.
- The cyclones, which cross 20o N latitude generally, re-curve and they are more destructive.
- A mature tropical cyclone is characterized by the strong spirally circulating wind around the centre, called the eye. The diameter of the circulating system can vary between 150 and 250 km. The eye is a region of calm with subsiding air.
- Around the eye is the eye wall, where there is a strong spiraling ascent of air to greater height reaching the tropopause. The wind reaches maximum velocity in this region, reaching as high as 250 km per hour. Torrential rain occurs here.

From the eye wall rain bands may radiate and trains of cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds may drift into the outer region.

### Difference Between Extratropical and Tropical Cyclones

The extratropical cyclone differs from the tropical cyclone in number of ways.

- The extratropical cyclones have a clear frontal system which is not present in the tropical cyclones.
- Extratropical cyclones cover a larger area and can originate over the land and sea. Whereas the tropical cyclones originate only over the seas and on reaching the land they dissipate.
- The extratropical cyclone affects a much larger area as compared to the tropical cyclone. The wind velocity in a tropical cyclone is much higher and it is more destructive.
- The extratropical cyclones move from west to east but tropical cyclones, move from east to west.

### Tropical Cyclones And Their Related Hazards

- Tropical cyclones are characterized by destructive winds, torrential rainfall and storm surges disrupt normal life with the accompanying phenomena of floods.
- Tropical cyclones have devastating potential to damage structures, viz. houses; lifeline infrastructure-power and communication towers; hospitals; food storage facilities; roads, bridges and culverts; crops etc.
- The most fatalities come from storm surges and the torrential rain flooding the lowland areas of coastal territories.
- The Indian subcontinent is one of the worst affected regions in the world. The subcontinent with a long coastline is exposed to nearly 10 per cent of the world’s tropical cyclones.
- Of these, the majorities of them have their initial genesis over the Bay of Bengal and strike the East coast of India. On an average, five to six tropical cyclones form every year, of which two or three could be severe.

**Effective safety measures against cyclones**

- A cyclone forecast and warning service.
- Rapid communication of warnings to the Government agencies, the ports, fishermen, ships and to the general public.
- Construction of cyclone shelters in the cyclone prone areas, and Administrative arrangements for moving people fast to safer places.

### Why More Cyclones Hit Eastern Coast Of India?

With a coastline of 7517 km, India is exposed to nearly 10 per cent of the world’s tropical cyclones. Although cyclones affect the entire coast of India, the eastern coast is significantly more prone to cyclones as compared to the western coast.

NCRMP (National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project) data show that about 58 percent of the cyclones that are formed in the Bay of Bengal hit and cross the eastern coast while only 25 percent of the cyclones developing in the Arabian sea are seen approaching the western coast of India.

- The temperature of the sea surface and humidity are the most important factors responsible for the formation of cyclones. The average rainfall seen by the Bay of Bengal is very high and hence the probability of the formation of cyclones in this region is also correspondingly very high.
- Tropical depression is a predominant occurrence in the Indo-Gangetic plains and this natural phenomenon is highly responsible for the cyclone formation in the Bay of Bengal.
- Bay of Bengal witnesses an average temperature of 28 degree Celsius. Warm air and the fresh water pouring into the bay from the rivers in the region increase the surface temperature of the sea further resulting in tropical depression.
- Cyclonic winds from other water bodies are transferred by Bay of Bengal. The lack of landmass in the Bay of Bengal basin means that the cyclones occurring in the region do not weaken and easily move towards the eastern coastline.

### Cyclone Season

Cyclone season: April to December is the cyclone season but over 65% of all cyclones occur in the last four months of the year.

[![Cyclones and Anticyclones](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Cyclones-and-Anticyclones6.jpg)

![Cyclones and Anticyclones](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Cyclones-and-Anticyclones6.jpg?resize=525%2C293&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Cyclones-and-Anticyclones6.jpg)

Bay of Bengal receives the remnants of major cyclones (typhoons) from west Pacific Ocean. And, most of the typhoons in west Pacific in northern hemisphere form between June and November, rather than April-May. So Oct-Dec period in India receives majority of cyclones from both in-situ developed cyclones and remnants cyclones from west Pacific Ocean.

The another reason that more cyclones strike in October is that wind shear — the difference within wind speeds and direction at two different levels — is low during this time. Low wind shear, when combined with surface sea temperatures greater than 26°C, raises the likelihood of cyclones. In monsoon season, cyclones are rare because of high wind shear.

RE- CURVING OF CYCLONES

- The cyclones in the northern hemisphere rotate anti-clockwise.
- They derive their strength from the moisture in waters such as the Bay of Bengal and move west, inclined in a northerly direction and peter out into the sea or land, depending on their origin.
- On its way to diminish, sometimes, if cyclone gets a sort of second wind by deflecting right or eastwards, then it is known as re-curving cyclones.
- This happens due to air currents in the local atmosphere that push cold air from the poles towards the equator and interfere with cyclone formation.
- In the southern hemisphere, the cyclones spin clockwise and therefore also re-curve in the opposite direction

### Climate Change and Tropical Cyclones

- Warming of the surface ocean from anthropogenic (human-induced) climate change is likely fueling more powerful Tropical Cyclones.
- The destructive power of individual Tropical Cyclones through flooding is amplified by rising sea levels, which very likely has a substantial contribution at the global scale from anthropogenic climate change.
- In addition, Tropical Cyclones’ precipitation rates are projected to increase due to enhanced atmospheric moisture associated with anthropogenic global warming.
- The proportion of severe Tropical Cyclones has increased, possibly due to anthropogenic climate change. However, most climate model studies project a corresponding reduction in the proportion of low-intensity cyclones, so the total number of Tropical Cyclones each year is projected to decrease or remain approximately the same.

### Anti Cyclone

- An anticyclone is a weather phenomenon defined as a large-scale circulation of winds around a central region of high atmospheric pressure.
- It rotates clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counter clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere (opposite to a cyclone).
- Effects of surface-based anticyclones include clearing skies as well as cooler, drier air. Fog can also form overnight within a region of higher pressure.

## World Climatic Regions

The study of climate is very important. Climate affects the life and activities of man and also the topography.
The flora and fauna of a landscape also depend upon climates.
It is, therefore, necessary to classify different climates into few major groups having certain common important characteristics.

### Classification of Climate of the World

- Several attempts have been made to classify climate of the world to delimit the major types in quantitative terms.
- However, it should be remembered that no classification is complete or perfect in all respects.
- The value of the classification is determined by the intended use.
- The first attempt to classify climate was made by the Greeks.
  - They defined climate as a study of the conditions of atmosphere at a definite time and under definite conditions.
  - On the basis of the temperature, they divided the earth into **Torrid (Tropical), Temperate (mid-latitude) and Frigid (polar) zones.**
  - The boundaries were determined by the parallels of latitudes.

[![World Climatic Regions](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions.jpg)

![World Climatic Regions](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions.jpg?resize=525%2C541&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions.jpg)

- Since that time, many classifications were devised.
- However, the classification scheme put forward by **Koeppen** has been found to be very popular.

### Koeppen’s Classification

World Climatic Regions
Koeppen’s classification is based on quantitative values of temperature and precipitation.
It recognises location and points out the differences that exist between the east and west coast and between the coastal regions and interiors.
The types of climate have been defined in terms of numerical values.
The major divisions are denoted by capital letters and small letters are added to indicate other small sub-divisions. The small letter generally conveys special features of the climate.
Koeppen completed his classification scheme at two stages.
First, he identified five major groups of climate and represented by capital letters A, B, C, D and E.
Another capital letter H has been also included to represent the climate of highlands.
These five major groups of climate have been further sub-divided into a number of climatic types on the basis of temperature and precipitation differences and by adding small letters.
World Climatic Regions

#### Humid Tropical Climate

- The areas having this kind of climate occupy almost half of the earth’s surface, (over 20 per cent of the land and 40 per cent of the ocean surface).
- This climatic group is bounded by the **mean annual isotherm of 20°C**.
- The hot deserts of North Africa and Arabia lying within this area are excluded from this group because of their extreme aridity.
- In this belt, temperature is more or less uniform.
- Principal climatic types within this group are identified basically on the basis of their seasonal distribution of rainfall.

---

**The Tropical Rainforest or Equatorial Climate (Af):**

[![World Climatic Regions](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions3.jpg)

![World Climatic Regions](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions3.jpg?resize=525%2C236&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions3.jpg)

- The climate is found in the belt extending from equator to **10°N and 10°S latitudes.**
- Along the windward margin of the continents, this climate may extend up to 20° North and South latitudes.
- The Amazon basin, the Congo basin and the South-east Asian Island have this type of climate.
- This climate has uniformly high temperature throughout the year, the annual average being about 27°C.
- The daily range of temperature is in between 10°C and 25°C.
- The annual range is, however, less than 5°C.
- Rainfall is heavy and distributed throughout the year.
- The annual average rainfall is about 250 cm.
- The constantly high temperature and all the year round rainfall help to produce the most luxuriant vegetation in the region, which is known as the **tropical rainforest**

---

**The Savanna Climate (Aw):**

[![World Climatic Regions](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions4.jpg)

![World Climatic Regions](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions4.jpg?resize=525%2C217&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions4.jpg)

- This climatic type is bounded by tropical rainforest climate toward the equator and by dry climates towards the poles.
- Areas having a savanna climate are the Sudan and Veld Plateau of Africa, the tropical grasslands of northern Australia, the Llanos of the Guiana highlands of South America and the Campos of Brazil.
- It represents a transitional zone which gets convectional rainfall during the summer, whereas during rest of the year it remains dry under the dominating influence of the trade winds.
- The temperature is high throughout the year, the annual average temperature being about 23°C.
- The annual range of temperature is 5°C to 6°C.
- The annual rainfall is about 160 cm.
- Wet summers alternate with dry winters.
- Floods and droughts are quite common.
- Duration of the rainy season and the average amount of annual rainfall decrease with the increasing distance from the equator.
- Similarly annual range of temperature also increases away from the equator.
- Here the tropical rainforest gives way to the savanna, the tropical grassland with scattered deciduous trees.

---

**The Monsoon Climate (Am):**

[![World Climatic Regions](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions5.jpg)

![World Climatic Regions](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions5.jpg?resize=525%2C229&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions5.jpg)

- The monsoon climate is found in India, South-east Africa, Northern Australia, the Guinea Coast of West Africa and the Pacific Coast of Columbia.
- The monsoon climate is characterised by seasonal reversal of wind direction associated with alternating periods of rainfall and drought.
- During the summer season, humid unstable air moves from the ocean. Conditions are, therefore, conducive to rainfall.
- In winter, a dry wind originating over the land blows towards the seas.
- The monsoonal circulation system having reversal of wind direction develops in response to the differences in annual temperature variations between continents and oceans.
- During summer, the intense heating of Central Asia produces an area of very low pressure, whereas in the Southern Hemisphere there exists the sub-tropical high pressure over the oceans.
- The south-east trades flow from the high pressure to the low pressure area and are deflected to the right and reach India and south-east Asia as on-shore south and south-westerly winds.
- These winds are laden with moisture and, therefore, cause heavy rainfall in these parts of the Asian Continent.
- During winter, the excessive cooling in central Asia intensifies the high pressure belt and the off-shore north-east trades blow over south-east Asia.
- Due to the presence of the Himalaya, these cold winds are prevented from descending into the Indian Peninsula. Temperatures are low during this season.

#### The Dry Climates

[![World Climatic Regions](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions6.jpg)

![World Climatic Regions](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions6.jpg?resize=500%2C248&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions6.jpg)

The dry climates have been sub-divided into the arid or desert type, and the semi-arid or steppe type. These two climatic sub-divisions have many features in common. Their differences are primarily a matter of degree.

In Koeppen’s classification, three variables have

been used in the formula to establish the boundary between dry and humid climates.

**These variables are:**

- - Average annual temperature;
  - Average annual precipitation; and
  - Seasonal distribution of precipitation.

---

**(i) The Desert Climate (BWh):**

- The chief feature of any desert climate is the scarcity of water.
- This happens where evaporation exceeds precipitation.
- Aridity or dryness is not simply a matter of low precipitation, but of the ‘effective precipitation’.
- For example, 25 cm of precipitation may be sufficient to support the forest cover in Scandinavia where evaporation is less in the cool moist air.
- But the same amount of rainfall in Iran can support only a sparse vegetative cover because evaporation is very high in hot dry air.
- Hence, no specific amount of precipitation can serve as a universal boundary for dry climates.
- The arid deserts lie in the low-latitudes close to the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn.
- The Sahara, the Arabia, the Thar, South-western USA, South-western Africa and central Australia have this type of climate.
- This climate is dominated by the subsidence of air masses and marked stability of the sub-tropical anti-cyclones and hence, nearly rainless.
- Precipitation is not only scanty but is also very erratic.
- The cloudless sky and low humidity allow a great amount of solar radiation to reach the ground during the day and permit rapid terrestrial radiation at night.
- Consequently, low-latitude deserts in the interior of the continents have the highest daily ranges of temperature on the earth, which is more than 15°C.
- Average annual temperature is about 38°C.
- Tropical deserts located along the west coast of continents reveal marked influence of cold ocean currents on their climates.
- For example, Atacama in Peru and Chile and the Namibia in south-west Africa have lower annual average as well as annual and diurnal ranges of temperature compared to other locations at similar latitudes, but in other parts.
- However, these areas receive the lowest annual rainfall totals in the world despite their location adjacent to the oceans.
- In fact, the aridity in this part is intensified because of the cold off-shore waters which chill the air and further stabilise it.

---

**(ii) The Steppe (BSk/BSh):**

[![The Dry Climates](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions7.jpg)

![The Dry Climates](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions7.jpg?resize=525%2C266&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions7.jpg)

- Unlike the low-latitude deserts, the steppes are not controlled by the subsiding air masses of the sub-tropical anti-cyclones.
- Instead, these are dry lands principally because of their position in the deep interiors of large land masses away from the oceanic influences.
- In addition, presence of mountain barriers across the paths of the prevailing winds further restricts maritime influences.
- The middle latitude deserts have steppe climates and are, therefore, most widespread in North America and Eurasia.
- This climatic type is characterised by meagre and unreliable precipitation like the tropical deserts.
- However, annual average (21°C) and annual ranges of temperature (13°C) are a comparatively lower.
- The annual rainfall is 30 cm.
- Steppes located on the poleward side on the deserts receive maximum rainfall during the cool season, while those located towards the equator receive it during the warm season.

#### Warm temperate Climates

This climatic group is sub-divided into the Mediterranean, China and West European climatic types. The coldest month is below-18°C, but temperature never goes below-30°C. The warmest month records temperature over 10°C.

---

**(i) The Mediterranean Climate (Cs):**

[![Warm temperate Climates](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions9-1.jpg)

![Warm temperate Climates](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions9-1.jpg?resize=525%2C303&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions9-1.jpg)

- This climate is found along the west coasts of continents between 30° and 45° latitudes.
- It is bounded by the arid steppe on the equatorward side and the marine west European climate on the poleward side.
- Areas around the Mediterranean sea, central California, central Chile, southern part of South Africa and south-eastern and southern-western parts of Australia experience this climate.
- As there is seasonal shift of pressure belts with the annual movements of the sun, these areas come under the influence of subtropical high-pressure conditions during summer, and cyclonic low-pressure conditions during winter.
- Summers are, therefore, warm and dry, temperature remains in between 20°C and 27°C.
- Winters are mild with temperature ranging between 4°C and 10°C.
- The annual range of temperature is about 10° to 17°C.
- Rainfall is moderate and varies between 40 and 60 centimetres.
- Most of the rainfall occurs in the winter season.

---

**(ii) The Humid Subtropical Climate or the China Type (Cwa/Cfa):**

[![Warm temperate Climates](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions11-1.jpg)

![Warm temperate Climates](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions11-1.jpg?resize=525%2C261&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions11-1.jpg)

- The humid subtropical climate is found along the eastern coasts of continents between 25° and 45° latitudes.
- It occurs in the southern-eastern United States, Uruguay, Argentina, southern Brazil, eastern China, southern Japan and eastern coastal belt of Australia.
- Summers are hot and humid. Winters are mild.
- The average annual temperature is 20°C and the average annual range of temperature is about 17°C.
- Yearly precipitation totals area usually more than 100 centimetres.
- It is well distributed throughout the year.
- These areas experience dreaded hurricanes and typhoons, mostly in late summer and autumn.

**(iii) The Marine West European Climate (Cwb/Cfb):**

[![Warm temperate Climates](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions12.jpg)

![Warm temperate Climates](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions12.jpg?resize=480%2C213&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions12.jpg)

- The climate is found along the western coasts of continents from about 40° and 65° north and south latitudes.
- This climate is dominated by the on-shore flow of oceanic air.
- Under the influence of maritime air masses, the areas under Cwb/Cfb experience mild winters, cool summers and ample amount of rainfall throughout the year.
- This climate is found most widely in Europe, where in the absence of any mountain barrier running north-south, the movement of cool maritime air is not restricted.
- In North and South America, this climate is found only in narrow belt, along the cost, because of the presence of mountain barriers.
- Besides these areas, New Zealand and south-eastern tip of Australia also experience this climate.
- Weather remains highly variable and unpredictable throughout the year under the influence of cyclonic low pressure system.
- The average annual rainfall is about 140 centimetres.
- The winters are rainier than the summers.

#### Cold Snow forest Climates (D)

Humid mid-latitude climates having low temperatures have been sub-divided into the taiga climate, the cool east coast, and the continental climates.

Cold Snow forest Climates (D)

(i) The Taiga Climate (Dwd/Dwe/Dfe):

This climatic type has been named after the coniferous forest cover found in the region.
This climatic region covers broad expenses from Western Alaska to Newfoundland in North America, and from Norway to the Kamchetka Peninsula in Eurasia.
The climate is dominated by continental polar air masses.
The summers are short with average temperature 15°C.
The winters are long and very cold. Minimum temperature may be as low as -50°C (recorded at Verkhoyansk in January).
The precipitation is low and concentrated in warmer months.
Despite its small amount, it is sufficient for tree growth because evaporation is less.
The vegetation associated with this climatic type is the soft-wood coniferous forest.
(ii) The Cool East Coast Climate (Dwa):

This climate is found in areas located along the north-eastern coast of the United States, northern China, Japan, Korea and lower Danube plains.
The summers are long, hot and humid under the influence of tropical maritime air masses.
Average summer temperature is 25°C. The winters are cold and the average winter temperature ranges between -40°C and 0°C. Precipitation is variable.
Summer rainfall is characteristic and is convectional in nature.
In winter, precipitation is usually less than in summer, and falls mostly in the form of snow.
(iii) The Continental Climate (Dfa):

The climatic region is situated in the interior parts of the big continents between the Taiga and the mid-latitude deserts.
In Eurasia, it spreads from Poland and Baltic States to the central Russian Plain.
Beyond the Ural mountains, the belt is narrow and runs along the 55° parallel.
In North America this climate is found in the northern states of the United States and in the southern parts of the central states of Canada.
Temperature is usually higher than those of the Taiga type climate, but is lower than those of the cool east coast climate.
Summers are short and warm, temperature being in between 10°C and 21°C. Winters are long.
Temperature goes down below freezing point.
Precipitation is variable and comes mostly in summer as rainfall.
Winter precipitation is in the form of snow.

#### The Cold / Polar Climate (E)

Polar climates are those in which the mean temperature of the warmest month is below 10°C. These are thus characterised by the absence of a warm period and by long cold conditions. This climatic group has been sub-divided into two types—the Tundra Climate in which the warmest month has a temperature above freezing point but is less than 10°C; and the Ice-caps climate in which the warmest month has temperature below 0°C.

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/World-Climatic-Regions14-1.jpg)

---

**(i) The Tundra Climate (Et):**

- It is found almost exclusively in the Northern Hemisphere occupying the coastal fringes of the Arctic Ocean and many Arctic islands and the ice-free shores of Iceland and Greenland.
- Winters are severe but summers are cool.
- Annual temperature ranges are high.
- Precipitation is in small amount.
- Temperature of the warmest month does rise above 0°C, but never above 10°C.
- As such, the ground may be free from snow, but for a short period.
- The 10°C summer isotherm thus marks the equatorward limit of the Tundra as well as the Poleward limit of tree growth.
- Only sparse vegetation is possible which comprises grasses, mosses and lichens.

---

**(ii) The Ice-cap Climate (Ef):**

The Ice-cap climate does not have a single monthly mean above 0°C. Consequently, the growth of vegetation is prohibited and it is a region of permanent ice and snow.

#### Climate of Highlands

- In mountainous regions, altitude and insolation play important roles in controlling temperature and precipitation.
- On high mountains the effect of high altitude is almost the same as that of high latitudes on the globe.
- This may be revealed by altitudinal zonation of vegetation from foot of the mountains to their tops.
- In Highland Climate high insolation, low temperature, low air pressure, large diurnal ranges of temperature and relatively large amount of precipitation at higher altitudes are common.
- This type of climate is found in the Alps, the Himalayas, the Tibetan Plateau, the Rockies and the Andes.
