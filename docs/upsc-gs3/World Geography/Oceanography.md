# Oceanography

## Bottom Relief features

- Our earth is the only planet in the solar system which has water in abundance, hence, it is often called a ‘watery Planet’.
- About 71 % of the earth’s surface is covered by water.
- Oceans form a single, large, continuous body of water encircling all the landmass of the earth.
- They account for four- fifth of the Southern Hemisphere and three fifth of the Northern Hemisphere.
- They contain 97.2 percent of the world’s total water.
- There are five principal oceans in the world which are separated largely on the basis of their geographical locations.
- These are the Pacific Ocean, the Indian ocean, the Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic Ocean. All the other seas, inland seas or the arms of the oceans, are counted within these four main oceans.
- The National Geographic Society for the first time named the Southern Ocean as the newest of Earth’s five oceans as of June 2021.

### Relief Features

Relief Features

The ocean water conceals a considerable variety of landscape very similar to its counterpart on the continents. There are mountains, basins, plateaus, ridges, canyons and trenches beneath the ocean water too. These relief features found on the ocean floor are called submarine relief. The Ocean basins are broadly divided into four major sub-divisions.

They are: (a) Continental shelf; (b) Continental slope; (c) Abyssal plains and (d) The ocean deeps.

Bottom relief features

#### Continental Shelf

#### **Continental Shelf:**

- There is no clear or well-defined line separating oceans from continents.
- Infact, continents do not end abruptly at shoreline.
- They slope seaward from the coast to a point where the slope becomes very steep.
- The shallow submerged extension of continent is called the **continental shelf.**
- The depth of this shallow sea water over the continental shelf ranges between **120 to 370 metres.**
- The width of the continental shelf varies greatly ranging between a **few kilometres to more than 100 kilometres.**
- This variation can be seen even in the context of Indian peninsula.
- The continental shelf off the eastern coast of India is much wider than that of the western coast.
- Similar variations are seen all over the world.
- Off the coast of West Europe, it extends to 320 kilometres from the Cape of Land’s End. Off the coast of Florida the shelf is 240 kilometres wide.
- They are much narrower or absent in some continents, particularly where fold mountains run parallel or close to the coast as along the eastern Pacific Ocean.
- Most of the continental shelves represent land which has been inundated by a rise in sea level.
- Many regard their formation due to the erosional work of waves or due to the extension of land by the deposition of river borne material on the off-shore terraces.
- Off the coast regions which were once covered by ice sheets, they may have developed due to glacial deposits.

#### **Importance of continental shelves:**

- The continental shelves are of great importance to man.
- The shallow water over the shelf enables sunlight to penetrate through the water to the bottom and encourages growth of microscopic plants and animals called planktons.
- These planktons are the food for fishes.
- Continental shelves are the source of fishes, mineral including sand and gravel.
- A large quantity of the world’s petroleum and natural gas is obtained from these shelves.
- The Bombay High and the discovery of petroleum in the Godavari basin are examples of on shore drilling on the continental shelf.
- Coral reefs and lipoclastic materials are also common on continental shelves.

**Submarine canyons**

[![Submarine canyons](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Submarine-canyons.png)

![Submarine canyons](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Submarine-canyons.png?resize=473%2C272&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Submarine-canyons.png)

- One of the striking features of the continental shelf is the presence of submarine canyons which extend to the continental slope.
- These canyons are ‘steepsided valleys’ cut into the floor of the seas.
- They are very similar to the gorges found on the continents.
- Godavari Canyon in front of the Godavari river mouth is 502 metres deep.
- One of the reasons for the formation of submarine canyon is underwater landslide.
- The sediments collected on the continental shelves get dislodged by a storm or a earthquake. The force of these moving sediments erode the slopes as they come down and as a result submarine canyons are carved out.
- The continental shelf is generally considered to be territorial water extent of the nations to which it adjoins.

#### Continental Slope

[![Continental Slope](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Continental-Slope.jpg)

![Continental Slope](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Continental-Slope.jpg?resize=525%2C296&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Continental-Slope.jpg)

- The continuously sloping portion of the continental margin, seaward of the continental shelf and extending down to the deep sea floor of the abyssal plain, is known as continental slope.
- It is charactersied by gradients of 2.5 degrees.
- It extends between the depth of 180 to 3600 metres.
- In some places, for example, off the shore of Philippines, the continental slope extends to a great depth.
- Continental slopes, mainly due to their steepness and increasing distance from the land have very little deposits of sediments on them.
- Sea life is also far less here than on the shelf.
- Along the base of the continental slope is a **deposit of sediments**. This belt of sedimentary deposits form the **continental rise**.
- In some regions the rise is very narrow but in others it may extend up to 600 km in width.

#### Abyssal Plain

Abyssal plains are extremely flat and featureless plains of the deep ocean floor.
In fact, the abyssal plains are likely the most level areas on the earth.
Abyssal plains covering a major portion of ocean floor between the depth of 3000m to 6000m.
They were once regarded as featureless plains but modem devices have shown that they are as irregular as the continental plain or surface.
They have extensive submarine plateaus, hills, guyots and seamounts.
The floor of the abyssal plain is covered by sediments.
The plains close to the continents are covered mostly by sediments brought down from the land.
But those seas which favour, an abundant growth of organisms have a thick layer of sediments, formed from the remains of living things.
These sediments are called
Some of the open seas do not support enough life to produce ooze on the floor.
They are covered with a type of sediment called red clay which is of volcanic origin or made up of tiny particles brought by wind and rivers.

**Submarine Ridges**

The lofty mountain systems which exist on the continents are also represented beneath the ocean waters.
These oceanic mountains are known as submarine ridges.
They are linear belts occurring near the middle of the oceans and are also called mid-oceanic ridges.
All the mid oceanic ridges constitute a world-wide system which is interconnected from ocean to ocean.
These ridges are intersected by faults.
The oceanic ridge is the site of frequent earthquakes.
Volcanism is common in ocean ridges and it produces many relief features.
The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is the largest continuous submerged mountain ridge which runs from north to south in the Atlantic-Ocean.
It is in the shape of S. At some places, the peaks, rise above the surface of water in the form of islands.
Many of the islands are volcanic in origin. The East Pacific Ridge and Carlsberg Ridge are some of the important submarine ridges.

**Seamounts and Guyots**

Scattered over the entire sea floor are thousands of submerged volcanoes with sharp tops called seamounts.
Sometimes they rise above the sea as isolated Islands.
Hawaii and Tahiti Islands are the exposed tops of volcanoes.
Volcano rising above the ocean floor whose top has been flattened by erosion and is covered by water is called guyot.

#### The Ocean Deeps

- The ocean deeps are the deepest part of the ocean.
- They are long, narrow, steep sided and flat-floored depressions on the ocean floor.
- They are generally called submarine trenches.
- These trenches are not always located in the middle of the ocean basins, as may be generally expected but are situated very close or parallel to the continents bordered by fold mountains.
- They are usually found adjacent to the areas of volcanic and earthquake activity.
- Great earthquakes and tsunamis are born in them.
- They occur in all the major oceans.
- The Pacific Ocean has the largest number of trenches.
- The Mariana Trench in ‘the Pacific Ocean is the deepest known part of the oceans. This trench is so deep that if we place the highest mountain of the world – the Mt. Everest in it, even this shall have a few kilometers of water above its summit.

### Bottom Reliefs of the Atlantic Ocean

[![Bottom Reliefs of the Atlantic Ocean](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bottom-Reliefs-of-the-Atlantic-Ocean.png)

![Bottom Reliefs of the Atlantic Ocean](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bottom-Reliefs-of-the-Atlantic-Ocean.png?resize=467%2C554&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bottom-Reliefs-of-the-Atlantic-Ocean.png)

- The Atlantic Ocean located between North and South Americas in the west and Europe and Africa in the east covers an area of 82,000,000 km2which is 1/6th of the geographical area of the globe and half of the area of the Pacific Ocean.
- The **‘S’ shape** of the ocean indicates the fact that landmasses (continents) on its either side were once a contiguous part.
- The Atlantic Ocean was formed due to drifting of North and South Americas to the west due to plate tectonics.
- The ocean widens to the south of equator and attains the maximum width of 5,920 km at 35°S latitude.
- It narrows down towards the equator. It is only 2560 km wide between Liberian coast and Cape Sao Roque.
- The width further increases northward and it becomes 4800 km at 40°N latitude.
- It narrows down in the extreme north where it maintains its contact with the Arctic Ocean through Norwegian Sea, Denmark Strait and Davis Bay.
- The average depth of the ocean is less than the Pacific Ocean because of extensive continental shelves and marginal and enclosed seas.
- About 24 per cent of the Atlantic Ocean is less than 915m deep.
- The Atlantic Ocean was first formed about 700 million years ago due to seafloor spreading (see fig. 5.13) and westward movement of the Eurasian and African plates from the mid-Atlantic ridge.
- About 300 million years BP (before present) the Atlantic Ocean was closed due to convergence of the American and Eurasian-African plates.
- The ocean again started to open about 150 million years BP due to the movement of aforesaid plates in opposite directions.
- The widening of the ocean still continues which is evidenced through seafloor spreading at an average rate of 4 cm per year.

#### **Continental Shelf:**

- Continental shelves have developed along both the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean and the width ranges from 2-4 km to more than 80 km.
- In fact, the width of continental shelves has been largely controlled by the reliefs of the coastal lands.
- These become significantly narrow where mountains and hills border the coasts e.g., the African shelves between Bay of Biscay and Cape of Good Hope and Brazilian shelves between 5°S and 10°S latitudes.
- The shelves become 200 to 400 km wide along the north-eastern coast of North America and the north-western coast of Europe.
- Extensive shelves are found around Newfoundland (Grand Bank) and British Islands (Doggar Bank).
- Similarly, the continental shelves around Greenland and Iceland are quite wide.
- Very extensive continental shelves are found in the South Atlantic Ocean mainly between Bahia Blanca and Antarctica .
- Many **marginal seas** are located on the continental shelves in the North Atlantic but such seas are practically absent in the South Atlantic.
- Among the continental shelf-seated seas significant are the Hudson Bay, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, the Davis Strait, the Denmark Strait etc.
- The Caribbean and Mediterranean seas represent enclosed seas.
- There are **several islands** which are located on the continental shelves e.g. British Isles, Iceland, Faeroes, Azores, Ascension, Tristan da Cuncha, Newfoundland, West Indies, Maderia, St. Helena, Trinidad, Falkland, South Orkneys, Shetlands,Georgia, Sandwitch, Canaries, Cape Verde etc. are significant islands representing different locations and origin.

#### **Mid-Atlantic Ridge:**

- The mid-Atlantic ridge representing the zone of divergent or constructive plate margins (American plates moving westward and Eurassian and African plates moving to the east) is the most striking relief feature which having S shape extends for 14,450 km from Iceland in the north and to Bouvet Island in the south.
- Though swinging west and east it maintains its central position and nowhere goes down more than 4000m below sea level.
- The ridge is known as **Dolphin Rise to the north** and **Challenger Rise to the south** of equator.
- It is known as **Wyville Thompson Ridge** between Iceland and Scotland.
- The ridge becomes quite extensive to the south of Greenland and Iceland and is called **Telegraphic Plateau** because first cabbies were laid down in this area.
- A significant branch emerges from this central ridge near 50° latitude and extends north-westward as Newfoundland Rise and continues upto New-found-land.
- Another important branch known as Azores Rise bifurcates from the mid- Atlantic Ridge to the south of 40°N latitude and extends up to Azores Islands.
- At the equator the ridge sends off two branches.
- Sierra Leone Rise extends towards north-east and Para Rise stretches in northwest direction.
- Guinea Ridge, a minor branch of the central ridge, runs north-eastward and extends up to Guinea coast.
- Two significant branches come out of the central ridge near 40°S latitude.
- The Walvis Ridge extends towards north-east and merges with African continental shelf while Rio Grande Rise extends towards South American coast.
- Though major part of the mid-Atlantic Ridge is submerged under oceanic water but a host of peaks and sea mounts project well above the water surface and form islands.
- **The Pico Island of Azores** is the highest peak which rises 8,229.6m (27,000 feet) above the sea floor and 213.36m to 243.84 m above sea level.
- Besides, the mid-Atlantic Ridge has several well-marked fracture zones e.g. Gibbs Fracture Zone (near 40°N), Atlantis Fracture zone (near 30°N), Oceanographic Fracture Zone (32°N), Kane Fracture Zone (25°N), Vema Fracture Zone (10°N), Romancha Fracture Zone (near equator) etc.
- As regards the origin of this unique feature all the previous theories based on compressive and tensional forces stand redundant due to advent of plate tectonic theory.
- The mid-Atlantic Ridge is the result of **westward movement of American plate and eastward movement of Eurasian and African plates.**
- This ridge represents the zone of the divergent or constructive plate margins where basaltic lavas rise continuously, get solidified and are slided equally on both sides of the ridge.
- The divergence of plates from this ridge is evidenced by the presence of several transform faults (fracture zones, as referred to above).

#### **Ocean Basins:**

The mid-Atlantic Ridge divides the Atlantic Ocean into two major basins viz. East and West Atlantic Basins.

**There are few important basins within these two major basins :**

**(1) Labrador basin** extends between the continental shelf of Greenland in the north and Newfoundland Rise in the south covering latitudinal extent of 40° N to 50°N where the depth of the basin ranges from 4,000 to 4,500m.

**(2) North American basin** is the most extensive basin of the Atlantic Ocean and extends between 12°N and 40° latitudes. The east-west section lies between the continental shelves off the east coast of N. America and 50°W meridian. The depth of the basin is more than 5000m but a few deeps measure more than 6000m depth.

**(3) Brazilian basin** is confined between the equator and 30°S latitude and east coast of Brazil in the west and Para Rise in the east. The depth is more than 4,000m.

**(4) Spanish basin** is located between the mid- Atlantic Ridge and Iberian Peninsula. It is bordered by Azores Rise in the south and extends upto 50°N latitude. The average depth is 5,000m.

**(5) North and South Canary basin** is comprised of two almost circular basins and is 5,000m deep.

**(6) Cape Verde basin** is located between the mid- Altlantic Ridge and west African coast and extends from 10° N to 23.° N. Average depth is 5000 m but at few places it becomes 5000 m or more.

**(7) Guinea basin** extends from north-east to southwest in elongated shape between Guinea Ridge and Sierra Leone Rise and measures 4,000 to 5,000 m in depth.

**(8) Angola basin** is located between the equator and 30°S latitude. It stretches from the African coast in the north-east to the knot of the mid-Atlantic Ridge and Walvis Ridge in the south-west. The basin is most extensive near the African coast and narrows down towards south-west. The average depth is 5,000m.

Cape Basin (25°S-45°S), Agulhas Basin (40°S- 50°S), Argentina Basin (35°S-50°S, depth 5,000m- 6,000m) and Atlantic-Antarctic Basin are the other significant basins of the Atlantic Ocean.

#### **Ocean Deeps:**

- The number of deeps in the Atlantic Ocean is far less than in the Pacific Ocean because of the absence of the effects of Tertiary orogenic movements along the Atlantic coasts.
- Murray has identified 29 deeps upto the depth of 3,000 fathoms (5,486.4m) in the Atlantic Ocean.
- **Nares Deep (6,000m), Pureto Rico Deep (8,385m), Hatteras Deep (5,445m), Columbia Deep (5,125m, south of Haiti), Valdivia Deep (3,134 fathoms), Tizard or Romanche Deep (9,370m), Buchanan Deep (3,063 fathoms), Moseley Deep (3,309 fathoms), Vema Deep** (4,900m) etc. are a few important ocean deeps of the Atlantic Ocean.

#### **Marginal Seas**

- The Mediterranean Sea, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico are significant marginal seas in the Atlantic Ocean.
- The Mediterranean Sea is divided into two major basins (East and West Basins) by 4,000m deep mid-sea ridge which runs from the southern Italian coast to the north African coast.
- The Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea are separated by a 1,600 m deep ridge running between Yucatan Peninsula and Cuba Island.
- The prominent basins are Mexico basin and Caribbean basin.
- The latter is further divided into four sub-basins e.g. Yucatan basin, Cayman trough, Columbia basin and Venezuela basin.

### Bottom Reliefs of the Pacific Ocean

- The Pacific Ocean, the largest ocean of the world having one-third area of the globe, extends from east to west for 16,000 km from the east coast of Asia in the west to the west coasts of Americas in the east and for 14,880 km from north to south between Bering Strait in the north to Cape Adre (Antarctica) in the south.
- The overall shape of the ocean is **triangular** if its extent in both the hemispheres is considered separately.
- Average depth of the ocean in 4,572m.
- Both the coasts (east and west) of the Pacific are paralleled by the chains of folded mountains and therefore the descent from the coast to the abyssal plains is very steep.
- More or less uniform broad and extensive ocean floor is characterized by several swells, rises, sea mounts and depressions (trenches and deeps).
- The Ocean has the largest number of islands (more than 2,000). It may be pointed out that the western coast is studded with islands, island arcs and festoons while the eastern coast has only a few islands.
- **The islands of the Pacific are grouped in 3 categories e.g.:**
  - The continental islands (Aleutian Islands, islands off British Columbia of Canada, and Chilean island)
  - Island arcs and festoons (Kuriles, Japanese Archipilago, Philippines and Indonesian islands)
  - S**cattered smaller islands which are further subdivided into two major sub-categories e.g.:**

1.  1.  **Islands based on racial grouping such as:**
    2.  Melanesia (Solomons, New Hebrides and Fizi)
    3.  Micronesia (Marshalls, Carolines, Gilbert and Ellice)
    4.  Polynesia (Society, Cook, and Tuamotu)
    5.  **Islands formed of volcanic materials and coral reefs** (Hawaii island-volcanic island, Fizi, Faunafuti, Ellice etc. coral islands).

#### **The Pacific Ocean has been divided into four sub-regions:**

**(1) The Northern Pacific** represents the deepest part of the whole Pacific where average depth ranges between 5000m and 6000m. This region makes contact with the Arctic Sea through Bering Strait.

**(2) The Central Pacific** is characterized by largest number of islands most of which are of volcanic and coral origin. H.H. Hess has identified 160 flat-topped sea mounts in this region. There are a few sub-parallel island chains which have been named by E. Suess as Oceanides.

**(3) The South-West** **Pacific** carries a large number of islands, marginal seas, extensive continental shelves and oceanic trenches.

**(4) The South-East Pacific** has the most striking relief of the Pacific Ocean as the East Pacific Rise or Ridge but there is absence of marginal seas.

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bottom-Reliefs-of-the-Pacific-Ocean.png)

#### **Continental Shelf:**

- There is significant difference in the extent and characteristics of continental shelves on the eastern and western coasts of the Pacific.
- The shelves are quite broad and extensive along the eastern coasts of Australia and Asia where the width varies from 160 km to 1600 km and the depth ranges between 1000 m and 2000m.
- Several islands are seated on these broad continental shelves (viz. Kuriles, Japanese islands, Philippines, Indonesia, New Zealand etc.).
- These continental shelves also carry numerous marginal seas like Bering Sea, Okhotsk Sea, Japan Sea, Yellow Sea, China Sea, Java Sea, Coral Sea, Tasmania Sea, Arafura Sea etc.
- The continental shelves are less extensive along the western coasts of Americas because of nearness of cordillerean chains of folded mountains to the coastal lands.
- The average width is 80 km.

#### **East Pacific Rise:**

- The Pacific Ocean does not have central or mid- oceanic ridge like the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans, albeit there are a few scattered ridges having local importance.
- The East Pacific Rise or Ridge known as Albatross Plateau is 1600 km wide and it extends from north of New Zealand to the Californian coast.
- It sends off two branches between 23°S-35°S.
- The eastern branch merges with Chilean coast while the other branch moves southward in the name of Eastern Island Rise.

#### **Galapagos Ridge**

**A minor ridge known as Galapagos Ridge runs parallel to the East Pacific Ridge in the east between the Eastern Island Fracture Zone and Galapagos islands from where in moves in two branches viz.:**

(i) Carnegie Ridge, and

(ii) Cocos Ridge in north-east direction.

**The New Zealand Ridge**: The New Zealand Ridge is about 200m to 2000 m below sea level and widens near Fiji island to form Fiji Plateau which is 2000 m below sea level.

**The Hawaiian Rise** extends from north-west to south-east direction between 35°N -17°N for a distance of 960 km. This is the most extensive ridge (2640 km wide) of the Pacific Ocean.

The **other minor ridges** are

- Nazca Ridge off Peru coast, Lord Howe Rise off eastern coast of Australia between 20°S and 40° S latitude.
- Norfolk Island Ridge between New Caledonia and New Zealand (23°S-35°S)
- Eauripik-New Guinea Rise north of New Guinea and parallel to 140°E longitude
- Caroline- Soloman Ridge north of Soloman Islands etc.

Besides, there are a few fracture zones running from west to east e.g., (from north to south) Mendocino Fracture Zone (40°N), Murray Fracture Zone (30°N), Molokai Fracture Zone (25°N), Clarion Fracture Zone (20°N), Clipperton Fracture Zone (10°N), Eastern Island Fracture Zone (30°S), Challenger Fracture Zone (40°S) etc.

#### **Ocean Basins:**

There are different basins of different shapes and sizes. These basins are separated by ridges and ‘rises’.

**The following are a few important basins of the Pacific Ocean:**

**(1) Philippine basin** is located to the east of Philippines and extends from south of Japan to 5°N latitude. Kyushu – Paian Ridge runs through the middle of the basins. Average depth ranges from 5000m to 6000m.

**(2)Fiji basin** is located to the south of Fiji Island between 10°S and 32°S latitudes and the average depth is 4000m. The basin to the north of 20°S is known as North Fiji Basin whereas the South Fiji Basin between 20°S and 32°S is bordered by Norkolk Island Ridge in the west and Karmadec – Tonga Trenches in the east.

**(3) East Australian basin** is situated between the east coast of Australia and New Zealand Ridge with average depth of more than 5000m.

**(4) South Australian Basin** also known as Jeffreys Basin is located to the south-east of Australia having average depth of 5000m.

**(5)Peru basin** is located to the west of Peru coast between 5°S and 24°S latitudes and extends upto 110°W longitude. The average depth of the basin is 4000m.

**(6) South-Western Pacific basin** is an elongated basin stretching between 20°S and 50°S latitudes and 180-129°W longitudes. Karmadec Trench with the depth of 10,047 m is located to the west of this basin.

(**7)Pacific-Antarctic Basin** is located to the southwest of Chilean coast between 40°S and 60°S latitudes and extends up to 130°W longitude.

**Oceans Deeps:**

There are several trenches and deeps in the Pacific Ocean. These depressions are located either along the island arcs or mountain chains. It may be pointed out that the trenches are found mainly in the western Pacific Ocean.

**The following are the significant trenches:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/trenches-of-Pacific-Ocean.png)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/trenches-of-Pacific-Ocean.png)

The genesis of oceanic trenches and deeps is related mainly to tectonic activities caused by plate motions.

### Bottom Reliefs of the Indian Ocean

- The Indian Ocean is smaller than the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean in areal extent and is bounded by, on all of its sides, Asia in the north, Africa in the west, Asia in the east, Australia in the south-east and Antarctica in the south.
- The ocean has contact with the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans in the south near Antarctica.
- The average depth of the ocean is 4000m.
- Major parts of the coastal lands of the Indian Ocean formed by the block mountains of Gondwanaland are compact and solid.
- The coasts of the East Indes are bordered by fold mountain chains.
- The marginal seas are less in number than the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans.
- Significant marginal seas are Mozambique Channel, Red Sea, Persian Gulf, Andman Sea, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal etc.
- Malgasy (Madagascar) and Sri Lanka are the big islands whereas Suqutra, Zanzibar, Comoro, Reunion, Secychelles, Prince Edwards, Crozet, Kerguelen, St. Paul, Rodriges, Maldive, Laccadive, Andman-Nicobar, Christmas etc. belong to the category of small and tiny islands.
- Indian subcontinent in the north divides the Indian Ocean into Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal.
- The ocean widens in the south

**The Indian Ocean is divided into  3 zones on the basis of regional characteristics:**

**(1) The Western Zone** between African coast and the mid-Indian Oceanic Ridge has large number of islands and the average depth is 3650 m (2000 fathoms).

**(2) The Eastern Zone** is deepest of all the zones with average depth of 550 m (3000 fathoms). The continental shelves are narrow but have steep slopes.

**(3) The Central Zone** represents the mid-oceanic ridge where many tiny islands are located.

#### **Continental Shelf:**

- There is wide range of variation in the continental shelves of the Indian Ocean.
- Quite extensive shelves are found along the margins of Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal.
- Similarly, extensive shelves are observed along the eastern coast of Africa and around Madagascar which is itself located on the continental shelves.
- On an average, the continental shelves are very wide (640 km) in the west whereas these are narrow (160 km) along the coast of Java and Sumatra.
- These become further narrow along the northern coast of Antarctica.

#### **Mid-Oceanic Ridge:**

- The central ridge or mid-oceanic ridge known as Mid-Indian Oceanic Ridge extends from the southern tip of Indian Peninsula in the north to Antarctica in the south almost in north-south direction and forms a continuous chain of highlands.
- Wherever the central ridge or its branches emerge above the sea level, islands are formed.
- The main central ridge starts from the continental shelf of the southern tip of Indian Peninsisula with average width of 320 km.
- This part of the ridge is known as Laccadive-Chagos Rigde (also known as Maldive Ridge).
- The ridge further extends southward and widens near equator. It is called Chagos- St. Paul Ridge between equator and 30°S latitude where the average width becomes 320 km.
- The ridge further widens to 1,600 km between 30°S and 50°S latitudes and is known as Amsterdam-St Paul Plateau.
- The central ridge bifurcates to the south of 50°S latitude.
- The western branch known as Kerguelen-Gaussberg ridge extends in NW-SE direction between 48°S and 63°S and the eastern branch is known as Indian-Antarctic Ridge.

#### **Branches of the Central Ridge:**

**(1) Socotra-Chagos Ridge** also known as Carlesbreg Ridge emerges from the central ridge at 5°S latitude and extends in northwesterly direction upto Gardafuli Peninsula of N. E. Africa,

**(2) Seychelles – Mauritius** ridge bifurcates from the main ridge around 18°S latitude near Mauritius Island and runs in roughly north-west direction in arcuate shape upto Seychelles and Amirante islands.

#### **Deeps and Trenches:**

- There are very few deeps and trenches in the Indian Ocean. About 60 per cent of the Ocean consists of deep sea plains with depth ranging from 3,600m to 5,487m.
- Important deep sea plains are Somali Abyssal plain.
- Ceylon (Sri Lanka) Abyssal plain, Indian Abyssal Plain, (4,380m) etc.
- Significant trenches are Java or Sunda Trench (7,450m deep), Ob Trench (6,875m deep), Mauritius Trench, Amirante Trench etc.

## Ocean Temperature

The temperature of the oceanic water is impor­tant for marine organisms including plants (phytoplanktons) and animals (zooplanktons). The tem­perature of sea water also affects the climate of coastal lands and plants and animals therein.

The study of both, surface and subsurface temperature of sea water is significant. Standard type of thermometer is used to measure the surface temperature while reversing thermometers and thermographs are used to measure the subsurface temperature.

### Sources of Ocean heat

#### **Radiation from the sun and sky:**

- The short-wave radiation that reaches the sea surface comes partly directly from the sun and partly from the sky as reflected or scattered radiation.
- The amount of radiation energy which is absorbed per unit volume in the sea depends upon the amount of energy that reaches the sea surface, the reflection from the sea surface, and the absorption coefficients for total energy.
- The incoming radiation depends mainly upon the altitude of the sun, the absorption in the atmosphere, and the cloudiness.
- With a clear sky and a high sun, about 85 per cent of the radiation comes directly from the sun and about 15 per cent from the sky, but with a low sun the proportion from the sky is greater, reaching about 40 per cent of the total with the sun 10 degrees above the horizon.

#### **Processes that Heat Ocean Water**

- Absorption of radiation from the sun and the sky
- Convection of heat through the ocean bottom , from the interior of the earth.
- Transformation of kinetic energy to heat.
- Heating due to chemical processes.
- Convection of sensible heat from the atmosphere.
- Condensation of water vapor.

#### **Processes That Cool Ocean Water**

- Back radiation from the sea surface
- Convection of sensible heat to the atmosphere
- Evaporation

### Range of Ocean Temperature

- The oceans and seas get heated and cooled slower than the land surfaces. Therefore, even if the solar insolation is maximum at noon, the ocean surface temperature is **highest at 2 p.m.**
- The average diurnal or daily range of temperature is barely 1 degree in oceans and seas.
- The highest temperature in surface water is attained at 2 p.m. and the **lowest, at 5 a.m.**
- The diurnal range of temperature is highest in oceans if the sky is free of clouds and the atmosphere is calm.
- The annual range of temperature is influenced by the annual variation of insolation, the nature of ocean currents and the prevailing winds.
- The maximum and the minimum temperatures in oceans are slightly delayed than those of land areas (the **maximum being in August** and the minimum in February \[Think why intense tropical cyclones occur mostly between August and October – case is slightly different in Indian Ocean due to its shape\]).
- The northern Pacific and northern Atlantic oceans have a greater range of temperature than their southern parts due to a difference in the force of prevailing winds from the land and more extensive ocean currents in the southern parts of oceans.
- Besides annual and diurnal ranges of temperature, there are periodic fluctuations of sea temperature also. For example, the 11-year sunspot cycle causes sea temperatures to rise after a 11- year gap.

### Distribution Patterns & Factors impacting distribution of temperature of Oceanic Water

#### **The distributional pattern of temperature of ocean water is studied in two ways viz.:**

(i) Vertical distribution (from surface water to the bottom)

(ii) Horizontal distribution (temperature of surface water)

Since the ocean has three dimensional shapes, the depth of oceans, besides latitudes, is also taken into account in the study of temperature distribution.

#### **Factors that affect the distribution of temperature of ocean water:**

**(1) Latitudes:**

- The temperature of surface water decreases from equator towards the poles because the sun’s rays become more and more slanting and thus the amount of insolation decreases poleward accordingly.
- The temperature of surface water between 40°N and 40°S is lower than air temperature but it becomes higher than air temperature between 40th latitude and the poles in both the hemispheres.

**(2) Unequal distribution of land and water:**

- The temperature of ocean water varies in the northern and the southern hemispheres because of dominance of land in the former and water in the latter.
- The oceans in the northern hemisphere receive more heat due to their contact with larger extent of land than their counterparts in the southern hemisphere and thus the temperature of surface water is comparatively higher in the former than the latter.
- The isotherms are not regular and do not follow latitudes in the northern hemisphere because of the existence of both warm and cold land- masses whereas they (isotherms) are regular and follow latitudes in the southern hemisphere because of the dominance of water.
- The temperature in the enclosed seas in low latitudes becomes higher because of the influence of surrounding land areas than the open seas e.g., the average annual temperature of surface water at the equator is 26.7°C (80°F) whereas it is 37.8°C (100°F) in the Red Sea and 34.4°C (94°F) in the Persian Gulf.

**(3) Prevailing wind:**

- Wind direction largely affects the distribution of temperature of ocean water.
- The winds blowing from the land towards the oceans and seas (e.g., offshore winds) drive warm surface water away from the coast resulting into upwelling of cold bottom water from below.
- Thus, the replacement of warm water by cold water introduces longitudinal variation in temperature.
- Contrary to this, the onshore winds pile up warm water near the coast and thus raise the temperature.
- For example, trade winds cause low temperature (in the tropics along the eastern margins of the oceans or the western coastal regions of the continents) because they blow from the land towards the oceans whereas these trade winds raise the temperature in the western margins of the oceans or the eastern coastal areas of the continents because of their onshore position.
- Similarly, the eastern margins of the oceans in the middle latitudes (western coasts of Europe and North America) have relatively higher temperature than the western margins of the oceans because of the onshore position of the westerlies.

**(4) Ocean currents:**

- Surface temperatures of the oceans are controlled by warm and cold currents.
- Warm currents raise the temperature of the affected areas whereas cool currents lower down the temperature.
- For example, the Gulf Stream raises the temperature near the eastern coasts of N. America and the western coasts of Europe.
- Kuro Shio drives warm water away from the eastern coast of Asia and raises the temperature near Alaska.
- Labrador cool current lowers down the temperature near north-east coast of N. America.
- Similarly, the temperature of the eastern coast of Siberia becomes low due to Kurile cool current.
- Warm currents raise the temperature more in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere which is apparent from the fact that the 5°C isotherm reaches 70° latitude in the northern Atlantic Ocean whereas it is extended up to only 50° latitude in the southern Atlantic Ocean.
- This is because of more dominant effects of the warm Brazil current in the southern Atlantic Ocean.

**(5) Minor Factors:**

**Minor factors include:**

(i) Submarine ridges

(ii) Local weather conditions like storms, cyclones, hurricanes, fog, cloudiness, evaporation and condensation, and

(iii) Location and shape of the sea.

### Horizontal Distribution of Temperature in Oceans

- On an average, the temperature of surface water of the oceans is 26.7°C (80°F) and the temperature gradually decreases from equator towards the poles.

[![Horizontal distribution of temperature of ocean water](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Horizontal-distribution-of-temperature-of-ocean-water.png)

![Horizontal distribution of temperature of ocean water](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Horizontal-distribution-of-temperature-of-ocean-water.png?resize=525%2C256&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Horizontal-distribution-of-temperature-of-ocean-water.png)

- The rate of decrease of temperature with increasing latitudes is generally 0.5°F per latitude.
- The average temperatures become 22°C (73°F) at 20° latitude, 14°C (57°F) at 40° latitude, and 0°C (32°F) near the poles.
- The oceans in the northern hemisphere record relatively higher average temperature than in the southern hemisphere.
- The highest temperature is not recorded at the equator rather it is a bit north of it. The average annual temperature of all the oceans is 17.2°C (63°F).
- The average annual temperatures for the northern and southern hemispheres are 19.4°C (67°F) and 16.1°C (61°F) respectively.
- The variation of temperatures in the northern and southern hemispheres is because of unequal distribution of land and ocean water.
- The decrease of temperature with increasing latitudes in the **northern Atlantic Ocean (figs. below)** is very low because of warm ocean currents.

[![Horizontal distribution of temperature of Atlantic Ocean Water](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Horizontal-distribution-of-temperature-of-Atlantic-Ocean-Water.png)

![Horizontal distribution of temperature of Atlantic Ocean Water](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Horizontal-distribution-of-temperature-of-Atlantic-Ocean-Water.png?resize=525%2C399&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Horizontal-distribution-of-temperature-of-Atlantic-Ocean-Water.png)

- The average temperature between 50°-70°N latitudes is recorded as 5°C (41°F). The decrease of temperature with increasing latitudes is more pronounced in the southern Atlantic Ocean.
- The highest temperature of surface water of the oceans is at 5°N latitude whereas the lowest temperature is recorded between 80°N and the north pole and between 75°S and the south pole.
- The average annual temperature of the Pacific Ocean is slightly higher than the Atlantic Ocean (16.91 °C or 60°F) and the Indian Ocean (17°C or 60.6°F).
- The lowest (3.3°C or 35.94°F) and the highest (32.2°C or 89.96°F) temperatures of the oceans are recorded near New Scotland and in the western Pacific Ocean respectively.
- The highest temperature of the Indian ocean (25°C or 82.4°F) is recorded in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal but the enclosed seas of the Indian Ocean record still higher temperatures (Red Sea = 32.2°C or 90°F and Persian Gulf = 34.4°C or 94°F).
- The average seasonal temperatures (February and August) of surface water of the oceans have been represented through isotherms .

[![Horizontal Distribution of Temperature of Indian Ocean Water](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Horizontal-distribution-of-temperature-of-Indian-Ocean-Water.png)

![Horizontal Distribution of Temperature of Indian Ocean Water](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Horizontal-distribution-of-temperature-of-Indian-Ocean-Water.png?resize=525%2C305&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Horizontal-distribution-of-temperature-of-Indian-Ocean-Water.png)

- The temperature of the surface water of the oceans is higher than the air temperature above the ocean surface which means ocean surface gives off heat to the atmosphere.
- This phenomenon influences the generation of oceanic circulation mainly sea waves and ocean currents.
- It has been observed that the air temperature at the height of 8m from the sea surface between 20°N and 55°S latitudes in the Atlantic Ocean is cooler by 0.80°C than the sea surface.
- There is a lot of variation in the heat emitted from the oceans to the atmosphere during winter and summer and this phenomenon causes differences of air temperature over the oceans and the continents mainly during winter season.
- The temperature for January is 22.2°C higher over the oceans between 20° and 80°N, while in July it is 4.8°C lower.
- The mean annual temperature is 7°C higher over the water meridian’.
- The difference between air and sea surface temperatures causes fogs over the seas and the oceans.
- This happens when warm air passes over a cold sea surface having the temperature below dew point of the air.
- Consequently the air over the sea surface is cooled from below and sea fog occurs.
- Generally, sea fogs are frequently formed during spring and early summer because air coming from over the land is warmer while the sea surface is still cold.
- Sea fogs are very common in the high latitudes but are generally absent in the tropics.

### Vertical Distribution of Temperature in Oceans

[![Vertical Distribution of Temperature in Oceans](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Vertical-Distribution-of-Temperature-in-Oceans.png)

![Vertical Distribution of Temperature in Oceans](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Vertical-Distribution-of-Temperature-in-Oceans.png?resize=380%2C483&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Vertical-Distribution-of-Temperature-in-Oceans.png)

It may be pointed out that maximum temperature of the oceans is always at their surface because it directly receives the insolation and the heat is transmitted to the lower sections of the oceans through the mechanism of conduction. In fact, the solar rays very effectively penetrate upto 20m depth and they seldom go beyond 200m depth.

[![Vertical section of Distribution of Temperature in Oceans](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Vertical-section-of-Distribution-of-Temperature-in-Oceans-1024x820.png)

![Vertical section of Distribution of Temperature in Oceans](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Vertical-section-of-Distribution-of-Temperature-in-Oceans.png?resize=525%2C420&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Vertical-section-of-Distribution-of-Temperature-in-Oceans.png)

Consequently, the temperature decreases from the ocean surface with increasing depth but the rate of decrease of temperature with increasing depth is not uniform everywhere. The temperature falls very rapidly upto the depth of 200m and thereafter the rate of decrease of temperature is slowed down.

**From this stand point the oceans are vertically divided into two zones**

(1) **Photic or euphotic zone** represents the upper surface up to the depth of 200m and receives solar radiation.

(2) **Aphotic zone** extends from 200m depth to the bottom and does not receive solar rays.

[![aphotic zone](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/aphotic-zone.png)

![aphotic zone](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/aphotic-zone.png?resize=525%2C321&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/aphotic-zone.png)

**The following are the salient features of vertical distribution of temperature of ocean water:**

1.  Though the sea temperature **decreases with increasing depth** but the rate of decrease of temperature is not uniform. The change in sea temperature below the depth of 2000m is negligible.
2.  **Diurnal and annual ranges of temperature cease after the depth of 5 fathoms** (30 feet) and 100 fathoms (600 feet) respectively.
3.  The rate of decrease of temperature with increasing depth from equator towards the poles is not uniform.

- - Though the surface temperature of the seas decreases from equator towards the poles but the temperature at the ocean bottoms is uniform from the equator towards the pole, which means that the rate of decrease of temperature with increasing depth is more rapid near the equator than towards the poles.

4.  The areas from where sea surface water is driven away by offshore winds resulting into upwelling of water from below record low temperature at sea surface and thus the rate of decrease of temperature with increasing depth becomes low.

- - Contrary to this the areas where there is pilling of sea water because of onshore winds, record relatively high temperature at sea surface and thus the rate of decrease of temperature with increasing depth becomes rapid.

5.  In some areas high temperature is recorded at greater depths e.g., in Sargasso Sea, Red Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Sulu Sea etc. The Mediterranean Sea records 24.4°C at the depth of 1,829m whereas the Indian Ocean has only 1.1°C temperature at the same depth. Such anomalous conditions are noticed in the enclosed seas of low latitudes. The enclosed seas of high latitudes register inversion of temperature i.e., the temperature of sea surface is lower than the temperature below.
6.  There is clear-cut layered thermal structure of ocean water.

**Vertically the oceans are divided into 3 layers from the stand point of thermal conditions of seawater, in the lower and middle latitudes as follows:**

(1**) The upper layer** represents the top-layer of warm water mass with a thickness of 500 meters with average temperature ranging between 20°C to 25°C. This lighter ocean water mass floats over the thickest heavy water mass of the oceans extending up to the ocean bottoms. This layer is present within the tropics throughout the year but it develops in middle latitudes only during summer season.

(2) **The lower layer** extends beyond 1000m depth up to the ocean bottoms. This layer is very cold and represents denser ocean water mass.

(3) The upper and lower ocean water masses are separated by **a transitional zone** of rapid change of temperature with increasing depth. This zone of ocean water mass is called **thermocline** which extends between 300m-1000m depth.

Besides, there are seasonal thermoclines between the depth of 40m and 100m.

These seasonal thermoclines are formed due to heating of water surface through solar radiation during summer season. There are also diurnal thermoclines which form in shallow water depth usually less than 10-15m. The polar seas have only one layer of cold water mass from the ocean surface (sea level) to the deep ocean floor.

## Salinity Distribution

The salinity of surface seawater is controlled primarily by the balance between evaporation and precipitation. As a result the highest salinities are found in the so-called sub-tropical central gyre regions centered at about 20° to 3° North and South, where evaporation is extensive but rainfall is minimal. The highest surface salinities, other than evaporite basins, are found in the Red Sea.

### Why is salinity important?

- Salinity, along with temperature, determines the density of seawater, and hence its vertical flow patterns in thermohaline circulation.
- Salinity records the physical processes affecting a water mass when it was last at the surface.
- precipitation/evaporation – salts excluded from vapor
- freezing/thawing – salts excluded from ice
- Salinity can be used as a conservative (unchanging) tracer for determining the origin and mixing of water types.

### Factors determining ocean water salinity

- **Evaporation**: The salinity of water in the surface layer of oceans depend mainly on evaporation. Where the evaporation is greater, the salinity is higher, for example, Mediterranean sea.
- **Freshwater flow influx**: Surface salinity is greatly influenced in coastal regions by the freshwater flow from rivers, and in polar regions by the processes of freezing and thawing of ice.
  - Where the freshwater flow into the oceans is greater, the salinity is lower.
  - For instance, at the mouths of rivers such as Amazon, Congo, Ganga etc., the ocean surface salinity is found to be lower than the average surface salinity.
- **Temperature and density**: Salinity, temperature and density of water are interrelated. Hence, any change in the temperature or density influences the salinity of an area.
  - In general, regions with high temperatures are also, regions with high salinity.
- **Ocean Currents**: They play an important role in the spatial distribution of dissolved salts in ocean waters.
  - The warm currents near the equatorial region push away the salts from the eastern margins of the oceans and accumulate them near the western margins.
  - Similarly, ocean currents in the temperate regions increase the salinity of ocean waters near the eastern margins. For instance, Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic Ocean increases the salinity of ocean waters along the western margins of the Atlantic Ocean.
- **Precipitation**: Precipitation and salinity share an inverse relationship.
  - In general, regions with higher levels of precipitation have lower levels of salinity. This is the reason why though the equatorial region is as hot as the sub-tropics, it records lower salinity than the sub-tropics since the former receives heavy precipitation in a day.
- **Atmospheric pressure and Wind direction:** anti-cyclonic conditions with stable air and high temperature increase salinity of the surface water of oceans
  - winds help is redistribution of salinity, as they drive away saline waters to less saline areas resulting into decrease of salinity in the former and increase in the latter

### Distribution of Salinity

Surface seawater salinities largely reflect the local balance between evaporation and precipitation.

- Low salinities occur near the equator due to rain from rising atmospheric circulation.
- High salinities are typical of the hot dry gyres flanking the equator (20-30 degrees latitude) where atmospheric circulation cells descend.
- Salinity can also be affected by sea ice formation/melting (e.g. around Antarctica)
- The surface N. Atlantic is saltier than the surface N. Pacific, making surface water denser in the N. Atlantic at the same temperature and leading to down-welling of water in this region this difference is because on average N. Atlantic is warmer (10.0 C) than N. Pacific (6.7 C).
- This is mostly because of the greater local heating effect of the Gulf Stream, as compared to the Kuroshio Current. Warmer water evaporates more rapidly, creating a higher residual salt content
- The influence of surface fluctuations in salinity due to changes in evaporation and precipitation is generally small below 1000 m, where salinities are mostly between about 34.5 and 35.0 at all latitudes.
- Zones where salinity decreases with depth are typically found occur at low latitudes and mid latitudes, between the mixed surface layer and the deep ocean. These zones are known as **haloclines.**

**The spatial distribution of salinity across oceans, is studied in two ways:**

- Horizontal Distribution of Salinity
- Vertical Distribution of Salinity

### Horizontal Distribution of Salinity

[![Salinity distribution in Surface waters](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Salinity-distribution-in-Surface-waters-1024x728.png)

![Salinity distribution in Surface waters](https://i0.wp.com/www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Salinity-distribution-in-Surface-waters.png?resize=525%2C373&ssl=1)

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Salinity-distribution-in-Surface-waters.png)

- On an average, salinity decreases from equator towards the poles. However, it is important to note that the highest salinity is seldom recorded near the equator though this zone records high temperature and evaporation but high rainfall reduces the relative proportion of salt. Thus, the equator accounts for only 35‰ salinity
- The highest salinity is observed between **20° N and 40° N** (36‰) because this zone is characterized by high temperature, high evaporation but relatively low rainfall
- The average salinity of 35‰ is recorded between 100 -300 latitudes in the southern hemisphere
- The zone between 40 deg -60 deg latitudes in both the hemispheres records low salinity where it is 31‰ and 33‰ in the northern and the southern hemispheres respectively.
- Salinity further decreases in the polar zones because of influx of Glacial melt-water. On an average, the northern and the southern hemispheres record average salinity of 35‰ and 34‰ respectively

### Vertical Distribution of Salinity

- Salinity at the surface of the sea is decreased by the input of fresh waters or increased by the loss of water to ice or evaporation. Thus both the trends of increase and decrease of salinity with increasing depths have been observed
- Salinity increases with increasing depth from 300 meters to 1000 meters in high latitudes i.e. there is positive relationship between the amount of salinity and depth because of denser water below but salinity becomes more or less constant beyond 1000 m depth
- Salinity decreases between the depth zone of 300 meters to 1000 meters in the low latitudes but it becomes more or less constant beyond 1000 m depth
- It appears from the above mentioned trends of vertical distribution of salinity that there is rapid rate of change of salinity (both increase and decrease) in the depth zone of 300m-1000m. This zone of steep gradient of salinity is called **halocline**
- Maximum salinity is found in the upper layer of the oceanic water. Salinity decreases with increasing depth. Thus, the upper zone of maximum salinity and the lower zone of minimum salinity is separated by a transition zone which is called as halocline, on an average above which high salinity is found in the low latitudes while low salinity is found in the high latitudes

[![Vertical Distribution of Salinity](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Vertical-Distribution-of-Salinity.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Vertical-Distribution-of-Salinity.png)

### Regional distribution of water salinity across the oceans

- **Indian Ocean**: The average salinity of the Indian Ocean is 35 parts per thousand . The low salinity is observed in the **Bay of Bengal** due to the influx of river water by the river Ganga. On the other hand, the **Arabian Sea** shows higher salinity due to high evaporation and a low influx of freshwater.
- **Pacific Ocean**: The salinity variation in the Pacific Ocean is mainly due to its shape and larger areal extent.
- **Atlantic Ocean**: The salinity in the Atlantic ocean varies between 20 to 37 parts per thousand according to the location.
  - For example, Near the equator, there is heavy rainfall, high relative humidity, cloudiness and calm air of the doldrums.
  - Whereas, The polar areas experience very little evaporation and receive large amounts of freshwater from the melting of ice. This leads to low levels of salinity, ranging between 20 and 32 parts per thousand
- **North Sea**: In spite of its location in higher latitudes, it records higher salinity due to more saline water brought by the North Atlantic Drift.
- **The Mediterranean Sea:** The Mediterranean Sea records higher salinity due to high evaporation. Surface waters average about **38 parts per thousand** in this sea
- **The Baltic Sea**: Baltic Sea records low salinity due to influx of river waters in large quantity, averaging around 35 parts per thousand
- **The Black Sea**: Salinity in the Black Sea is very low due to the enormous freshwater influx by rivers, averaging around 13–23 parts per thousand

## Waves and Tsunamis

- A classic **tsunami wave** occurs when the tectonic plates beneath the ocean slip during an earthquake.
- The physical shift of the plates force water up and above the average sea level by a few meters.
- This then gets transferred into horizontal energy across the ocean’s surface.
- From a single tectonic plate slip, waves radiate outwards in all directions moving away from the earthquake.
- **A tsunami is a set of waves created by a disturbance, likely an earthquake, which reaches the surface of the sea.**
- When a tsunami reaches shore, it begins to slow dramatically from contact with the bottom of the seafloor.
- As the leading part of the wave begins to slow, the remaining wave piles up behind it, causing the height of the wave to increase.
- Though tsunami waves are only a few feet to several meters high as they travel over the deep ocean, it is their speed and long wavelength that cause the change to dramatic heights when they are forced to slow at the shore.

#### **Formation of Tsunamis**

- Powerful undersea earthquakes are responsible for most tsunamis. Seismologists say only earthquakes measuring greater than 7.0 on the Richter scale can produce a major tsunami.
- Most earthquakes that generate tsunamis occur in areas called subduction zones, where pieces of the Earth’s crust press against each other. The friction between two slow-moving plates of the Earth’s crust creates vast amounts of seismic energy which is released in the form of an earthquake.
- When a strong undersea earthquake strikes a relatively short distance below the sea floor, it abruptly pushes up one of the immense plates of the Earth’s crust. That suddenly displaces an enormous amount of ocean water which becomes a tsunami, spreading outward in every direction from the epicenter of an earthquake – like ripples on a pond, only on a much larger scale.
- Tsunamis generated in the open ocean appear to be only small waves, but they can grow rapidly in size as they reach shallow water before crashing into seacoast settlements.
- Tsunami waves become dangerous only when they get close to the coast: the height of a Tsunami wave grows larger as the water becomes more and more shallow in a wave shoaling process
- An increase in wave amplitude results in “shoaling” when waves, including tsunamis, run from deep to shallow water. This is significant in coastal regions. This phenomena occurs because of the force from the seabed as it becomes shallower. This slows down the wave: the shallower the water, the slower the wave.
- Even when tsunamis have only a small amplitude (less than a meter) they can shoal up to many meters high as they hit shallow water. When a tsunami hits shallower coastal waters, the trough or base of the wave contacts the beach floor. As a consequence, the leading edge of the tsunami slows dramatically due to the shallower water, but the trailing part of the wave is still moving rapidly in the deeper water.
- The wave is compressed and its velocity slows below 80 kilometers per hour. Its wavelength diminishes to less than 20 kilometers and its amplitude is magnified many times. This piling up of tsunami energy results in growth of the wave height.
- The form of the adjacent geography to deep water (open bays and coastline), can shape the tsunami into a step-like wave with a steep braking face. The wave height as it crashes upon a shore depends almost entirely upon the submarine topography offshore. Steeper shorelines produce higher tsunami waves.
- Because of the factors of low amplitude in deep water and large wavelength, tsunamis are often not noticed in mid-ocean. As the tsunami hits shallower water, the velocity slows, wavelength decreases and the waves height (amplitude) increases.

#### **Areas that are prone to Tsunami:-**

- Damage is usually worst in areas closest to the undersea quake, often because the fast-moving waves will hit land so quickly.
- The areas most prone to tsunamis are coastal areas that are near earthquake-prone regions or near areas of undersea volcanoes and face the open ocean.
- Thus, the coast of Japan, south-east Asia and coastal parts of south-east India and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are prone to tsunamis, also Ring of fire in the pacific.

#### **Tsunami early warning system**

Tsunami waves are capable of destroying seaside communities with wave heights that **sometimes surpass around 66ft (20 m)**. Tsunamis have caused over 420,000 deaths since 1850—over 230,000 people were killed by the giant earthquake off Indonesia in 2004, and the damage caused to the Fukushima nuclear reactor in Japan by a tsunami in 2011 continues to wreak havoc. Although tsunamis cannot be predicted in advance when an earthquake occurs, tsunami warnings are broadcast and any waves can be tracked by a global network of buoys – this early warning system is essential because tsunamis can travel at over 400 miles per hour (644 km/hr). **The highest tsunami wave** reached about 1,720 ft (524 m), a product of a massive earthquake and rockslide. When the wave hit shore, it was said to destroy everything.

- It is made up of two equally important components:-
  - A network of sensors to detect tsunamis
  - A communications infrastructure to issue timely alarms to permit evacuation of the coastal areas.
  - It **is**made up of a network of seismic-monitoring stations and sea-level gauges. These detect earthquakes and abnormal changes in sea level and help scientists decide whether a **tsunami has** been triggered by an earthquake.
- When operating, seismic alerts are used to instigate the watches and warnings; then, data from observed sea level height (either shore-based tide gauges or DARTbuoys) are used to verify the existence of a tsunami.
- Other systems have been proposed to augment the warning procedures; for example, it has been suggested that the duration and frequency content of t-waveenergy (which is earthquake energy trapped in the ocean SOFAR channel) is indicative of an earthquake’s tsunami potential.
- At present, early warning systems rely on measuring the movement of dart buoys which record changes in the sea level or assessing the bottom pressure of the propagating tsunami. The problem is that these systems require the tsunami to physically reach the measurement location.
- With the speed at which tsunami waves travel through open water, no system can protect against a very sudden tsunami, where the coast in question is too close to the epicenter

**MeteoTsunamis**

- There are also other, usually less destructive tsunami waves caused by weather systems called meteotsunamis.
- These tsunami waves have similar characteristics to the classical earthquake driven tsunamis described above, however they are typically much smaller and focused along smaller regions of the oceans or even Great Lakes.
- Meteotsunamis are often caused by fast moving storm systems and have been measured in several cases at over 6 feet (2 meters) high.
- A 2019 study found that smaller meteotsunami waves strike the east coast of the U.S. more than twenty times a year.

## Coral Reefs

Coral reefs are large underwater structures composed of the skeletons of colonial marine invertebrates called coral.
Corals are of two types: Hard coral and Soft coral.
The coral species that build reefs are known as hermatypic, or “hard,” corals because they extract calcium carbonate from seawater to create a hard, durable exoskeleton that protects their soft, sac-like bodies.
Other species of corals that are not involved in reef building are known as “soft” corals. Soft corals, such as sea fingers and sea whips, are soft and bendable and often resemble plants or trees. These corals do not have stony skeletons, but instead grow wood-like cores for support and fleshy rinds for protection.
Deep-sea corals live in much deeper or colder oceanic waters and lack zooxanthellae. Unlike their shallow water relatives, which rely heavily on photosynthesis to produce food, deep sea corals take in plankton and organic matter for much of their energy needs.

## Currents

Ocean water Movements

Ocean currents are the continuous, predictable, directional movement of seawater driven by gravity, wind (Coriolis Effect), and water density.
Ocean water moves in two directions: horizontally and vertically.
Horizontal movements are referred to as currents, while vertical changes are called upwellings or downwellings.
This abiotic system is responsible for the transfer of heat, variations in biodiversity, and Earth’s climate system.

### Currents- Horizontal Movement

**Currents- Horizontal Movement**

- **Surface ocean currents**are driven by global wind systems that are fueled by energy from the sun.
  - These currents transfer heat from the tropics to the Polar Regions, influencing local and global climate.
  - The warm Gulf Stream originating in the tropical Caribbean, for instance, carries about 150 times more water than the Amazon River.
- **Deep Ocean currents** are caused by differences in water density, resulting from the variability of water temperature (_thermo_) and salinity (_haline_). This process is known as thermohaline circulation.
  - In cold regions, when sea water freezes, it leaves behind salt, increasing the density of the surrounding seawater. This sinks, making way for lighter, warmer water, thereby starting the ‘**global conveyer belt’.**

[![Currents](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1-3.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1-3.png)

### Global Distribution of Ocean Currents

- The general movement of the currents in the northern hemisphere is clockwise and in the southern hemisphere is anti-clockwise.
- This is due to the **Coriolis force which is a deflective force and follows Ferrel’s law**.
- A notable exception to this trend is seen in the northern part of the Indian Ocean where the current movement changes its direction in response to the **seasonal change in the direction**of monsoon winds.
- The warm currents move towards the cold seas and cold currents towards the warm seas.
- In the lower latitudes, the warm currents flow on the **eastern shores**and cold on the western shores \[food for imagination\].
- The situation is reversed in the higher latitudes. The warm currents move along the western shores and the cold currents along the eastern shores.
- At the surface, aspects of wind-driven circulation cause the **gyres**(large anticyclonic current cells that spiral about a central point) to displace their centres westward, forming strong western boundary currents against the eastern coasts of the continents, such as the Gulf Stream–North Atlantic–Norway Current in the Atlantic Ocean and the Kuroshio–North Pacific Current in the Pacific Ocean.
- In the Southern Hemisphere the counterclockwise circulation of the gyres creates strong eastern boundary currents against the western coasts of continents, such as the Peru (Humboldt) Current off South America, the Benguela Current off western Africa, and the Western Australia Current.
- The Southern Hemisphere currents are also influenced by the powerful eastward-flowing circumpolar Antarctic Current, which separates the Southern Ocean from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans.
- It is a very deep, cold, and relatively slow current, but it carries a vast mass of water, about twice the volume of the Gulf Stream.
- The Peru and Benguela currents draw water from this Antarctic current and, hence, are cold.
- The Northern Hemisphere lacks continuous open water bordering the Arctic and so has no corresponding powerful circumpolar current, but there are small cold currents flowing south through the Bering Strait to form the Oya and Anadyr currents off eastern Russia and the California Current off western North America; others flow south around Greenland to form the cold Labrador and East Greenland currents.
- The Kuroshio–North Pacific and Gulf Stream–North Atlantic–Norway currents move warmer water into the Arctic Ocean via the Bering, Cape, and West Spitsbergen currents.

### Factors Leading to Origin and Modification of Ocean Currents

- There are a variety of factors that affect how ocean currents (water in motion) are created, including a combination of two or more factors.
- The different types of currents (referred to as surface or thermohaline, depending on their depth) are created by, among other things, wind, water density, the topography of the ocean floor and the coriolis effect.

**Primary Forces Responsible for Ocean Currents:**

**Insolation**

- - Heating by solar energy causes the water to expand. That is why, near the equator the ocean water is about 8 cm higher in level than in the middle latitudes.
  - This causes a very slight gradient and water tends to flow down the slope. The flow is normally from east to west.

**Wind (atmospheric circulation)**

- - Wind blowing on the surface of the ocean pushes the water to move. Friction between the wind and the water surface affects the movement of the water body in its course.
  - Winds are responsible for both magnitude and direction \[Coriolis force also affects direction\] of the ocean currents. Example: Monsoon winds are responsible for the seasonal reversal of ocean currents in the Indian ocean.
  - The oceanic circulation pattern roughly corresponds to the earth’s atmospheric circulation pattern.
  - The air circulation over the oceans in the middle latitudes is mainly anticyclonic \[Sub-tropical High Pressure Belt\] (more pronounced in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere due to differences in the extent of landmass). The oceanic circulation pattern also corresponds with the same.
  - At higher latitudes, where the wind flow is mostly cyclonic \[Sub-polar Low Pressure Belt\], the oceanic circulation follows this pattern.
  - In regions of pronounced monsoonal flow \[Northern Indian Ocean\], the monsoon winds influence the current movements which change directions according to seasons.

**Gravity:**

- - Gravity tends to pull the water down to pile and create gradient variation.

**Coriolis force:**

- - The Coriolis force intervenes and causes the water to move to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere.
  - These large accumulations of water and the flow around them are called Gyres. These produce large circular currents in all the ocean basins. One such circular current is the Sargasso Sea.

**Shape of the Ocean basins:**

- - Another major factor that determines the direction of surface currents is the shape of ocean basins.
  - When a surface current collides with land, it changes the direction of the currents. Imagine pushing the water in a bathtub towards the end of the tub.
  - When the water reaches the edge, it has to change direction.

---

**Secondary Forces Responsible for Ocean Currents:**

- - **Temperature difference and salinity difference** are the secondary forces.
  - Differences in water density affect vertical mobility of ocean currents (vertical currents).
  - Water with high salinity is denser than water with low salinity and in the same way cold water is denser than warm water.
  - Denser water tends to sink, while relatively lighter water tends to rise.
  - Cold-water ocean currents occur when the cold water at the poles sinks and slowly moves towards the equator.
  - Warm-water currents travel out from the equator along the surface, flowing towards the poles to replace the sinking cold water.

### Vertical Movements

Vertical movements, often referred to as upwelling and downwelling, exhibit much lower speeds, amounting to only a few metres per month. As seawater is nearly incompressible, vertical movements are associated with regions of convergence and divergence in the horizontal flow patterns.

**Upwelling**

Water that has greater density usually sinks to the bottom.
However, in the right conditions, this process can be reversed.
Denser water from the deep ocean can come up to the surface in an upwelling.
Generally, an upwelling occurs along the coast when wind blows water strongly away from the shore.
As the surface water is blown away from the shore, colder water from below comes up to take its place.
This is an important process in places like California, South America, South Africa, and the Arabian Sea because the nutrients brought up from the deep ocean water support the growth of plankton which, in turn, supports other members in the ecosystem.
Upwelling also takes place along the equator between the North and South Equatorial Currents.
Currents

### Impact of Ocean Currents on Climate of Surrounding Regions

**Desert formation**

- - Cold ocean currents have a direct effect on **desert formation** in west coast regions of the **tropical and subtropical continents**.
  - There is **fog** and most of the areas are **arid due to desiccating effect (loss of moisture).**

**Rains**

- - Warm ocean currents bring rain to coastal areas and even interiors. Example: Summer Rainfall in **British Type climate**.
  - Warm currents flow parallel to the east coasts of the continents in tropical and subtropical latitudes. This results in warm and rainy climates. These areas lie in the western margins of the subtropical anti-cyclones.

**Moderating effect**

- - They are responsible for moderate temperatures at coasts. \[North Atlantic Drift brings warmness to England. Canary cold current brings cooling effect to Spain, Portugal etc.\]

**Drizzle**

- - Mixing of cold and warm ocean currents create foggy weather where precipitation occurs in the form of drizzle \[Newfoundland\].

**Climate**

- - Warm and rainy climates in tropical and subtropical latitudes \[Florida, Natal etc.\],
  - Cold and dry climates on the western margins in the sub-tropics due to desiccating effect,
  - Foggy weather and drizzle in the mixing zones,
  - Moderate clime along the western costs in the sub-tropics.

**Tropical cyclones**

- - They pile up warm waters in tropics and this warm water is the major force behind tropical cyclones.

### The Importance and Impact of Ocean Currents on The Coastal Countries Across the Globe

**Effects on climate and weather**: Ocean currents have significant impact on movement to heat energy and moisture between the oceans and the atmosphere as they circulate water worldwide.

- - For example, the **Gulf Stream** is a warm current which originates in the Gulf of Mexico and moves north towards Europe. It keeps the sea surface warm, which keeps Western Europe warmer than other areas at similar latitudes.
  - The **North Atlantic drift and Kuroshio warm currents bring in rainfall along the western coast of Europe and eastern coast of Japan respectively**.
  - **Labrador, Kurile and Falkland cold currents** are responsible for heavy snowfall in the affected areas during winters.
  - **The Benguela and Peru currents** have caused the existence of the **Kalahari Desert** along the Western coast of South Africa and the **Atacama Desert** along the South American coast respectively.
  - **The Humboldt Current** is a cold current moving off the coast of Chile and Peru.  It keeps the coast cool and the northern part of Chile arid. It leads to extremely productive waters. However, when El Nino disturbs the current, Chile’s climate is also altered.

**Effects on marine life**: Ocean currents are important for the distribution of world’s sea life as they transport nutrients, planktons, etc  from one area to another which favours the growth of fishes. The mixing of warm and cold currents lead to abundant fish catch in the coastal countries.

- - For example, ocean currents have enriched the famous fish catch areas of the **North Sea, Grand Bank and George Bank near Nova Scotia, Peruvian coast, Eastern Pacific near Japan, etc.**

**Ease & challenges of Navigation**: Since ancient times, sailors have used the knowledge of ocean currents and winds to ease navigation in sea routes around the coasts and across the globe.

- - Understanding of currents is essential to augment the speed of ships, reduce the shipping costs and fuel consumption and also to avoid obstacles such as icebergs and debris.
  - **Ice-free port in higher latitudes:** The Arctic port of Murmansk in Russia is ice free all year as the seas near Murmansk are warmed by relatively warm Atlantic water that flows into the Barents Sea via the Norwegian Current and North-Cape Current.
  - The convergence of cold and warm ocean currents causes **dense fogs which creates obstacles in navigation.**

**Transport of Debris**: Ocean currents also move the debris around the world which in turn leads to formation of icebergs as well as trash Islands.

- - For example, the Labrador Current and Falkland currents bring icebergs from Arctic and Antarctic oceans respectively into the shipping lanes in the north and South Atlantic oceans respectively.

**Energy Independence**: Ocean currents are emerging as a possible source of alternative energy for the coastal countries. As dense water carries an enormous amount of energy that can be captured and converted into usable form through use of water turbines.

## Tides

- Tides are very long-period waves that move through the oceans in response to the gravitational forces exerted by the moon and sun.
- Tides originate in the oceans and progress toward the coastlines where they appear as the regular rise and fall of the sea surface.
- When the highest part, or **crest,** of the wave reaches a particular location, **high tide** occurs**; low tide** corresponds to the lowest part of the wave, or its **trough**.
- The difference in height between the high tide and the low tide is called the **tidal range.**

- The time between the high tide and low tide, when the water level is **fallin  
  g**, is called the **ebb.**
- The time between the low tide and high tide, when the tide is **rising**, is called the **flow or flood**

**Formation of Tides:**

- The moon’s gravitational pullon the Earth and the Earth’s rotational force are the two main factors that cause high and low tides.
- The side of the Earth closest to the Moon experiences the Moon’s pull the strongest, and this causes the seas to rise, creating high tides.
- On the side facing away from the Moon, the rotational force of the Earth is stronger than the Moon’s gravitational pull.
- The rotational force causes water to pile up as the water tries to resist that force, so high tides form on this side, too.
- Elsewhere on the Earth, the ocean recedes, producing low tides.
- The gravitational attraction of the Sun also plays a small role in the formation of tides.
- Tides move around the Earth as bulges in the ocean.

### Characteristics of Tides

- The tidal bulges on wide continental shelves have greater height.
- In the open ocean tidal currents are relatively weak.
- When tidal bulges hit the mid-oceanic islands they become low.
- The shape of bays and estuaries along a coastline can also magnify the intensity of tides.
- **Funnel-shaped bays**greatly change tidal magnitudes. Example: **_Bay of Fundy –– Highest tidal range._**
- The large continents on the planet, however, block the westward passage of the tidal bulges as the Earth rotates.
- Tidal patterns differ greatly from ocean to ocean and from location to location.

### Types of Tides

**Bore Tide:**

- A tidal bore (or simply bore in context, or also aegir, eagre, or eygre) is a tidal phenomenon in which the leading edge of the incoming tide forms a wave (or waves) of water that travels up a river or narrow bay against the direction of the river or bay’s current.

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Types-of-Tides.png)

**Neap Tide:**

- When the Sun and Moon form a right angle, as when a half moon can be seen, their gravitational pulls fight each other and one can notice a smaller difference between high and low tides. These are called neap tides.

**Spring Tide:**

- When the Moon, Earth, and Sun fall in a straight line, which is called as syzygy (siz-eh-gee), the greatest difference between high and low tide water levels can be observed.
- These spring tides occur twice each month, during the full and new Moon.
- If the Moon is at perigee, the closest it approaches Earth in its orbit, the tides are especially high and low.

**Rip Tide:**

- A rip current, commonly referred to simply as a rip, or by the misnomer rip tide, is a strong channel of water flowing seaward from near the shore, typically through the surf line.
- Typical flow is at 0.5 meter-per-second (1–2 feet-per-second), and can be as fast as 2.5 meters-per-second (8 feet-per-second), which is faster than any human swimmer.
- They can occur at any beach with breaking waves, including oceans, seas and even large lakes.

**Brown Tide:**

- Brown Tide is a bloom (excessive growth) of small marine algae (Aureococcus anophagefferens).
- Although algae of many types are found in all natural freshwater and marine ecosystems, blooms of the Brown Tide organism literally turn the water deep brown, making it unappealing to swimmers and fishermen alike.
- While not harmful to humans, the presence of the Brown Tide is a problem for bay scallops and eelgrass, and to a lesser degree other finfish and shellfish.
- Brown Tide is unlike most other algal blooms because of its unusually high concentrations, the extent of area it covers and the length of time it persists.

**Red Tide:**

- Harmful algal blooms, (HAB) occur when colonies of algae grow out of control while producing toxic or harmful effects on people, fish, shellfish, marine mammals and birds.
- The human illnesses caused by HABs, though rare, can be debilitating or even fatal.
- Many people call HABs ‘red tides,’ scientists prefer the term harmful algal bloom.
- One of the best known HABs in the nation occurs nearly every summer along Florida’s Gulf Coast.

**Semidiurnal Tide:**

- These are tides occurring twice a day.
- This means a body of water with semi-diurnal tides, like the Atlantic Ocean, will have two high tides and two low tides in one day, much like the eastern seaboard of North America.

**Diurnal Tide:**

- These tides occur once a day.
- A body of water with diurnal tides, like the Gulf of Mexico, has only one high tide and one low tide in a 25-hour period.

](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Types-of-Tides3.jpg)

**Mixed Tide:**

- Some bodies of water, including most of North America that’s in contact with the Pacific Basin, have mixed tides, where a single low tide follows two high tides.

### Importance of Tides

**Marine ecosystem**

- Tides affect marine ecosystems by influencing the kinds of plants and animals that thrive in what is known as the **intertidal zone**—the area between high and low tide.
- Because the area is alternately covered and uncovered by the ocean throughout the day, plants and animals must be able to survive both underwater and out in the air and sunlight. They must also be able to withstand crashing waves.
- For example, plants and animals that can anchor themselves to the rocks along a shoreline can survive the lashing from waves and the less violent movement of the changing tides.
- Sand crabs not only burrow to survive, they actually follow the tides to maintain just the right depth in the wet sand.
- Along many shorelines, tides form **tide pools**. These small pools of water are often left behind among the rocks at low tide. They can include a diverse population of tiny plants and animals that may serve as food for larger species.

**Navigation**

- Tidal heights are very important, especially harbours near rivers and within estuaries having shallow **‘bars’ \[Marine Landforms\]**at the entrance, which prevent ships and boats from entering into the harbour.
- High tides help in navigation. They raise the water level close to the shores. This helps the ships to arrive at the harbour more easily.
- Tides generally help in making some of the rivers navigable for ocean-going vessels. **London and Calcutta\*\***\[Tidal Ports\]\*\* have become important ports owing to the tidal nature of the mouths of the Thames and Hooghly respectively.

**Fishing**

- The high tides also help in fishing. Many more fish come closer to the shore during the high tide. This enables fishermen to get a plentiful catch.

**Pollution mitigation**

- Tides are also helpful in desilting the sediments and in removing polluted water from river estuaries.

**Power generation**

- Tides are used to generate electrical power (in Canada, France, Russia, and China).

## Marine Resources

Marine resourcesare materials and attributes found in the ocean that are considered to have value. That value can be intrinsic, or monetary.
They include a huge number of things: biological diversity, fish and seafood supplies, oil and gas, minerals, sand and gravel, renewable energy resources, tourism potential, and unique ecosystems like coral reefs.
These resources can have great monetary value, and even when they don’t, the uniqueness and opportunity for education and human enrichment cannot be quantified.
The way we manage and use these resources is therefore of great importance.

### Formation Of Marine Resources

- **Fish and other marine life**form through evolution over millions and billions of years.
- **Oil and gas**form when dead marine plants and animals are left on the ocean bed and become covered in sediments over many years. When they get buried deeply enough, heat and pressure becomes so great that they are compressed and form oil. With higher heat and compression they can go a stage further and form natural gas.
- **Sand and gravel**are simply sediment that gets broken down by fast-moving rivers and then swept into the sea.
- **Minerals**form differently depending on the mineral, but generally form when lava from volcanoes solidifies.
- Water itself contains minerals, and when volcanoes erupt the lava solidifies to form rock that contains minerals.
- How fast the lava cools determines whether minerals form. It has to be slow enough that crystals form, since minerals are crystalline. The slower the lava cools, the larger the crystals.
- **Coral reefs**form when coral larvae attach to underwater rocks. These larvae grow to form the reef. Reefs usually form into one of three main structures: barrier reefs, atoll reefs, or fringing reefs.
  - Fringing reefs are most often found around coastlines and go from the shore straight out to sea.
  - Barrier reefs are also along the shore but at more of a distance, with deep water in between.
  - Atoll reefs begin as a fringing reef that surrounds an underwater volcano.
  - When the volcano recedes a barrier reef is formed. Once the reef reaches the surface, it becomes a circular atoll reef.

### Types of Marine Resources

- Oceans are vast reservoirs of biotic resources.
- Nearly 40,000 species of molluscs, and 25,000 species of fishes are found in marine waters.
- Besides mineral resources, different types of vitamins and medicinal elements are also found.
- Generally, marine resources are divided into **three categories**g**., biotic resources, abiotic (mineral and energy) resources and commercial resources (navigation, aviation, trade and transport etc.).**
- On an average, marine resources are also classified into **living resources and non-living resources.**
- Alternatively, marine resources can also be divided into **mineral resources, energy resources and food resources.**

### Impact of Anthropogenic Activities on Marine Resources

**Impact of anthropogenic activities on oceanic biodiversity**

- **As per** _**Global Biodiversity Outlook 5**_ (**GBO-5) 2020**
  - More than **60 percent of the world’s coral reefs biodiversity** are under threat
  - 2016 Marine heatwaves across north Australia led to severe bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, led to **mangrove die-offs** in the gulf of Carpentaria
  - The proportion of **fish stocks** fished sustainably is **down by 5 percent** since 2010
- **Impact of marine litter:** Ingestion, suffocation and entanglement of hundreds of marine species e.g. seabirds, whales, fishes. It contributes to **spread of invasive marine organisms and bacteria** which disrupts ecosystems, leading to mass loss of biodiversity.
  - **8 million tons of plastic** waste end up in ocean every year which make up for 80% of all marine debris (India dumps **6 lakh tones** of plastic waste annually)
- As per **Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services 2019**
  - Over **one-third of marine mammals** and nearly one-third of sharks, shark relatives, and reef-forming corals are threatened with extinction
  - **One million species** are threatened with extinction globally, and extinction rates have accelerated sharply in the past century.
  - **Human activities are the primary cause** of these huge declines, particularly in the ocean where fishing is driving the greatest biodiversity loss
- **Coastal land and sea use change** has had the second largest impact on marine biodiversity after over fishing.
  - Development along coastlines as well as offshore aquaculture, bottom trawling, and oil and gas extraction have altered habitats, and toxic pollutants in agricultural and industrial runoff poison **coastal fish harvests**.

**Impact of anthropogenic activities on Oceanic food**

- The **food chains of the world’s oceans** are at risk of collapse due to the release of greenhouse gases, overfishing and localized pollution
- The **acidification of the ocean,** where the pH of water drops as it absorbs carbon dioxide, will make it hard for creatures such as **coral, oysters and mussels to form the shells** and structures that sustain them.
- **Marine heatwaves impact on food system:**
  - It affects ecosystem structure by supporting certain species and suppressing others e.g. after marine heatwaves in western Australia (2016) fish communities had a much more **“tropical” nature:** changing the behavior and habitat range of fish.
  - Induced species range shifts, changes to vertical and across-shelf movement patterns, and losses in **spawning habitats**.
  - Marine heatwaves led to impacts on fisheries and aquaculture e.g. outbreaks of **Pacific Oyster mortality syndrome,** thus impacting oyster aquaculture
- **Issue of bioaccumulation and biomagnification:** Toxic contaminants accumulate on the surface of plastic materials which when ingested by marine organisms enter their digestive systems leading to bioaccumulation
  - Fish and other marine life ingest microplastics and nano plastic which in turn can find their way into the human food chain

**Impact on Oceanic ecosystem**

- As per UN’s 2nd **World Ocean Assessment** report:
  - The **number of “dead zones”** – ocean areas where insufficient oxygen allows nothing to survive – are increasing, thus impacting the local ecosystem.
  - There are now around 500 of these dead zones around the world.
- **Marine ecosystems are connected and thus impact is worldwide:** g. nutrients from the Amazon River have formed a seaweed bloom off the coast of West Africa that now exceeds 20 million tons 8,850 kilometers.
- **Impact on seagrass ecosystem (**considered **‘marine ecosystem engineers’):** Human disturbance like eutrophication, mechanical destruction of habitat, overfishing, siltation, trawling is disturbing seagrass ecosystem (e.g. sea cow grass, needle seagrass)
- **Impact on mangrove ecosystem:** India has **lost 40% of its mangrove’s areas** in the last century, mainly due to agriculture, aquaculture, tourism, urban development and over exploitation
- **Impact on coral reefs ecosystem**: According to a study, since 1982 three mass bleaching events occurred in 1998, 2010 and 2016 have occurred in India.
- **Impact on Polar ecosystem:**
  - **Antarctica’s species are already changing their habitats**. Many species have a narrow thermal tolerance.
    - **Adélie penguins**, **seals and krill** are all moving south to colder parts of the continent, and the two flowering plant species have become increasingly commonplace.
    - **Emperor penguins** are predicted to be extinct by the end of the century
  - **The Arctic** is warming **at least twice as fast (Arctic amplification)**as the rest of the planet: temperate species are moving farther and farther north.
    - There is higher **abundance of trout and other fish** that will compete with Arctic char, leading to a loss of those fish that are so vital for Indigenous communities
    - **Thawing permafrost** creates chocolate milk like pool. They’re thick with all the mud that’s coming through them.” This can quickly wipe out invertebrate and fish communities.
    - **Blooms in phytoplankton occurring** earlier in the year and even happening in autumn – a phenomenon rarely observed in Arctic waters previously.

### Impact of Oceanic Biodiversity Changes on Humans

- **Changes to fisheries:** Gross revenues from the world’s marine fisheries were around $150bn in 2010 USD, providing jobs for around 260 million people. As stocks are depleted and critical species are forced to migrate, millions **of livelihoods will be at threat**
- **Food Security:** Seafood is an essential for over 4.5bn people as 15% of their protein intake from seafood. Many of the populations are at risk from climate-related marine food insecurity, such as in the Pacific Islands and West Africa, reside in areas where land-based food production is also at risk.
- **Health:** Warming waters are also expected to expand the **range of certain bacteria and harmful algal blooms,** with potentially severe consequences for human health. Cholera is highlighted as one disease likely to become more of a threat that have already been observed spreading to the poles.

### Conservation Measures

**Global Biodiversity Outlook 5** (**GBO-5**) revealed none of the **Aichi Biodiversity Targets** (mandated governments to curb biodiversity loss by cutting pollution, managing fish stocks sustainably, removing subsidies that harm nature) have been fully achieved, and **only six were partially met**.

---

**Measures by India**

- - India is \_**on track t**\_o achieve the biodiversity targets and have overachieved on many of its target as given by **Sixth National Report (NR6) to CBD**
  - Stronger integration of **gender, Indigenous peoples and local communities**in conservation efforts
    - g. India’s **Wetland conservation rules 2017** advocated ‘wise use’ concept involving communities in conservation
  - **Included biodiversity**in national accounting systems
  - **India BIS standard** banned microplastic of less than 5mm diameter in personal care product
  - Government of India has taken steps to **protect its coral reefs** under Coastal Ocean Monitoring and Prediction system (COMAPS), Coral Bleaching Alert System (CBAS)
  - **Coral Reef Recovery Project**– is a joint venture of Wildlife Trust of India and the Gujarat Forest Department, supported by Tata Chemicals Limited (TCL)
  - **Kerala’s Suchitwa mission:** fishermen are engaged in not just finding fish but also plastic that either get stuck in the fishing nets or floats in the sea. 25 tonnes waste recovered in 10months
  - **Andhra Pradesh** has formed eco development committees and V**an Samrakshan Samithis** for joint implementation of projects in mangrove areas.
  - **Maharashtra** became the first coastal state to **declare a state mangrove tree species** as a symbol to enhance conservation of salt-tolerant vegetation

**International alliances:**

- **International blue carbon initiative:** mitigating climate change through the conservation and restoration of coastal and marine ecosystem
- **‘magical mangroves- join the movement**’ highlights significance of mangroves conservation
- **Blue Nature Alliance** It is a global partnership with aim is to advance Ocean Conservation Areas
  - The alliance is working on large-scale efforts in Fiji’s Lau Seascape, Antarctica’s Southern Ocean and the Tristan da Cunha island group to collectively secure **protections over 4.8 million square kilometers of the ocean**
- **GloLitter Partnerships Project**: aims to help the maritime transport and fishing sectors move towards a low-plastics future.
- **London Convention** (1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping Wastes and Other Matter)
- The Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities (GPA)
- **International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI)**– preserve coral reefs and related ecosystems around the world.

---

**Other measures:**

- - In Southeast Asia: **“blue infrastructure development”** and approaches such as **“building with nature,”** are being introduced as part of efforts to harmonize coastal protection and development with habitat and ecological protection
  - **Increasing our scientific knowledge base of the ocean:** new feats of technology, namely sensors and autonomous observation platforms, are collecting more granular data on oceans, including in remote areas.
  - **One Health model**that integrates ecosystems, agriculture, wildlife and urban landscapes into a singular approach to human and planetary health.
  - **2050 vision for biodiversity:** biodiversity be valued, conserved, restored and wisely used.

**30X30 target under UN:** protecting at least 30% planet by 2030

### What more needs to be done

- Transition from linear to **blue circular economy**
- **Increase the production of sustainably sourced ocean-based proteins**: ocean-based proteins are substantially less carbon intensive than land-based animal protein. Such diet shift will reduce deforestation
- **Decarbonize the international shipping sector:** reduce pm2.5 form marine engine combustion, reduce ship speeds could positively impact marine mammals and other species
- **Conserve and restore mangroves:** it will protect us from storm surges, provide ecosystem services like regulating water quality and reducing coastal erosion
- **Rebuilding overexploited or depleted fisheries**, and responsiveness of existing fisheries management strategies reduces negative climate change impacts on fisheries, with benefits for regional economies and livelihoods.
- **Restoration of vegetated coastal ecosystems**, such as mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass meadows (**coastal ‘blue carbon’ ecosystems)**
