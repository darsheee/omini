# World War – I

**Introduction**

- **World War I,** often abbreviated WW1, also known as the First World War and contemporaneously known as the **Great War**, was an international conflict that began on 28 July 1914 and ended on 11 November 1918
- The war pitted the **Central Powers**—mainly Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey—against the **Allies**—mainly France, Great Britain, Russia, Italy, Japan, and, from 1917, the United States
- It ended with the defeat of the Central Powers.
- The war was virtually unprecedented in the slaughter, carnage, and destruction it caused.
- World War I was one of the **great watersheds** of 20th-century geopolitical history.
  - It led to the **fall of four great imperial dynasties** (in Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey), resulted in the **Bolshevik Revolution** in Russia, and, in its **destabilization of European society**, laid the groundwork for World War II

**WW1: Causes**

- **Mutual Defense Alliances**
  - Countries throughout the world have always made mutual defense agreements with their neighbours, treaties that could pull them into battle. These treaties meant that if one country was attacked, the allied countries were bound to defend them
  - Hence, as a result of these agreements, many passively affected countries were pulled into the war
- **Imperialism**
  - Before World War I, several European countries had made competing imperialistic claims in Africa and parts of Asia, making them points of contention. Because of the raw materials these areas could provide, tensions around which country had the right to exploit these areas ran high.
  - The increasing competition and desire for greater empires led to an increase in confrontation that helped push the world into World War I.
- **Nationalism**
  - Much of the origin of the war was based on the desire of the Slavic peoples in Bosnia and Herzegovina to no longer be part of Austria-Hungary, but instead be part of Serbia
  - This specific essentially nationalistic and ethnic revolt led directly to the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand, which was the event that tipped the scales to war
  - But more generally, nationalism in many of the countries throughout Europe contributed not only to the beginning but to the extension of the war across Europe and into Asia

**World War 1: A Glimpse**

- **The Start of the War**
  - World War I began on July 28, 1914, when **Austria-Hungary** declared war on **Serbia**.
  - This seemingly small conflict between two countries spread rapidly: soon, Germany, Russia, Great Britain, and France were all drawn into the war, largely because they were involved in Treaties that obligated them to defend certain other nations
- **The Western and Eastern Fronts**
  - The first month of combat consisted of bold attacks and rapid troop movements on both fronts.
  - In the west, Germany attacked first Belgium and then France. In the east, Russia attacked both Germany and Austria-Hungary. In the south, Austria-Hungary attacked Serbia
  - Following the Battle of the Marne (September 5–9, 1914), the western front became entrenched in central France and remained that way for the rest of the war. The fronts in the east also gradually locked into place.
- **The Ottoman Empire**
  - Late in 1914, the Ottoman Empire was brought into the fray as well
  - First, Britain and France launched a failed attack on the Dardanelles. This campaign was followed by the British invasion of the Gallipoli Peninsula. Britain also launched a separate campaign against the Turks in Mesopotamia
- **Trench Warfare**
  - The middle part of the war, 1916 and 1917, was dominated by continued Trench Warfare in both the east and the west.
  - Soldiers fought from dug-in positions, striking at each other with Machine Guns, Heavy Artillery, and Chemical Weapons.
  - Though soldiers died by the millions in brutal conditions, neither side had any substantive success or gained any advantage
- **The United States’ Entrance and Russia’s Exit**
  - Despite the stalemate on both fronts in Europe, two important developments in the war occurred in 1917
  - In early April, the United States, angered by attacks upon its ships in the Atlantic, declared war on Germany
  - Then, in November, the Bolshevik Revolution prompted Russia to pull out of the war
- **The End of the War and Armistice**
  - Although both sides launched Renewed Offensives in 1918 in an all-or-nothing effort to win the war, both efforts failed.
  - A deadly **outbreak of Influenza**, meanwhile, took heavy tolls on soldiers of both sides.
  - The **war ended** in the late fall of **1918**, after the member countries of the Central Powers signed Armistice Agreements one by one
  - As a result of these agreements, Austria-Hungary was broken up into several smaller countries.
  - Germany, under the **Treaty of Versailles**, was severely punished with hefty economic reparations, territorial losses, and strict limits on its rights to develop militarily.

**WW1: Consequences**

World War I was the first truly global war and had a profound effect on the 20th century as follows:

- - **New technology**
    - One of the most significant impacts of World War One was huge advances in technology, which would transform the way that people all around the world **travelled and communicated**, in particular, in the years after the conflict
    - **New weapons and technologies** were developed and used that led to more destruction than any war had seen in the past
      - The scientists and engineers worked hard to develop planes that were stronger, quicker and capable of being used in battle
      - The first bombs were dropped from the air (by hand at first by the pilot!) and planes were used to spy on enemy territory.
      - Also, **tanks** were also used for the first time, which could drive across muddy battlefields and fire lethal weapons
      - **New methods of photography**, sound recording and ways to communicate were developed during the war, which had a long-lasting impact
  - **Medical innovation**
    - The war meant that medicine had to catch up to be able to deal with new Medical problems
    - Donating and giving blood started during World War One during need of intense causalities
    - A special rod called a Thomas splint, which was used on soldiers who had broken their leg, was also developed
  - **Role of women**
    - Up until the war, women were perceived in a certain way in society. Their role was traditionally to stay in the home.
    - When war broke out and the men went off to fight, it was women who took on their jobs and kept things running back in Britain.
      - By late 1918, nine in every ten workers in the munitions industry were female – jobs which traditionally would have been done by men
    - Many women also had to return to a more domestic life when the men came home as a result of a law called 1919 Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act.
    - So, there was a long way to go for **Women Equality**
  - **Reshaping of politics**
    - World War One spelled the end of the Ottoman Turkish empire and also contributed to the Russian revolution, which marked the beginning of a new politics system in action – communism.
  - **Contribution to World War Two**
    - It is accepted that the punishments put on Germany a result of the Treaty of Versailles after World War One contributed to WW2
      - In 1919, this treaty imposed harsh terms on Germany forcing them to accept the blame for the war and pay huge sums for the damages of the war
      - Thus ,at a time when the country was politically unstable and extremely poor, it was the perfect climate for Adolf Hitler

**WW1 and India**

- - **India’s contribution**
    - India made a huge contribution to Britain’s war effort. It sent staggering numbers of volunteers to fight and die on behalf of the allied forces
    - The country also supplied 170,000 animals, 3,7 million tonnes of supplies, jute for sandbags, and a large loan (the equivalent of about £2 billion today) to the British government
  - **India’s reaction to the War**
    - The nationalist response to British participation in the First World War was three-fold:
      - the Moderates supported the empire in the war as a matter of duty
      - the Extremists, including Tilak (who was released in June 1914), supported the war efforts in the mistaken belief that Britain would repay India’s loyalty with gratitude in the form of self-government
      - the revolutionaries decided to utilise the opportunity to wage a war on British rule and liberate the country
  - **Impact of WW1 on India**
    - **Political influence**
      - The withdrawal of Punjabi troops into India after the end of the war stimulated political activities against colonial rule in the province which later took the form of widespread protests. Also after the war, a large section of soldiers became active in Punjab to spread nationalism in a big way
      - Nationalism and mass civil disobedience emerged in India when the 1919 Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms failed to meet the expectations of ‘home rule’.
      - The resentment generated by the forced recruitment of soldiers for the war set the backdrop for the **promotion of nationalism**
    - **Social Impact**
      - Between 1911 and 1921, there was a significant increase in the **literacy rate** among the enlisted military communities. In those days, soldiers learned to read and write for their foreign campaigns
      - In addition, a large number of non-combatants were also recruited from India – such as nurses, doctors, etc. Therefore, during this war, the work area of **women** also expanded and they also gained social importance
    - **Economic impact**
      - The demand for Indian goods in Britain increased rapidly as the war on production capabilities in Britain was adversely affected
      - Although the war caused a disruption in the shipping lanes, it meant that Indian industries had to suffer inconvenience due to the lack of inputs previously imported from Britain and Germany. Hence **supply constraints** were present along with **additional demand**
      - Inflation was a consequence of war as well
        - Industrial prices almost doubled in the six years after 1914 and the rise in rising prices benefited Indian industries.
      - **Food inflation** also increased drastically due to an increase in demand for food supplies, especially grain.
      - Export of cash crops like jute also suffered heavy losses due to loss of European market
        - It is noteworthy that in the meantime there was a shortage of workers engaged in jute production in India due to increase in the demands of the soldiers and the production of jute mills of Bengal was also damaged
      - At the same time, the decline in British products in domestic manufacturing sectors like **cotton** also benefited which dominated the pre-war market.
