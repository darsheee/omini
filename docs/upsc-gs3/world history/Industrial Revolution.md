# Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in Europe and the United States, in the period from between 1760 to 1820 and 1840.This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing  and iron production processes, the increasing use of steam power and water power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the mechanized factory system. The Industrial Revolution also led to an unprecedented rise in the rate of population growth.

It is the process of change from an agrarian and handicraft economy to one dominated by industry  and machine manufacturing. These technological changes introduced novel ways of working and living and fundamentally transformed society.

The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. Some economists have said the most important effect of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population in the western world began to increase consistently for the first time in history, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries.

## Characteristics of the Industrial Revolution

The main features involved in the Industrial Revolution were technological, socio-economic, and cultural. The technological changes included the following:

(1) the use of new basic materials, chiefly iron  and steel.

(2) the use of new energy sources, including both fuels and motive power, such as coal, the steam engine, electricity, petroleum and the internal combustion engine.

(3) the invention of new machines, such as the spinning jenny and the power loom that permitted increased production with a smaller expenditure of human energy.

(4) a new organization of work known as the factory system, which entailed increased division of labour and specialization of function.

(5) important developments in transportation and communication, including the steam locomotive, steamship, automobile, airplane, telegram and radio.

(6) the increasing application of science to industry.

These technological changes made possible a tremendously increased use of natural resources and the mass production of manufactured goods.

## Reasons for Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the 1760s, largely with new developments in the textile industry.

The causes of the Industrial Revolution were complicated and remain a topic for debate. Geographic factors include Britain’s vast mineral resources. In addition to metal ores, Britain had the highest quality coal reserves known at the time, as well as abundant water power, highly productive agriculture, and numerous ports and navigable waterways.

- **Economic  and political competition:(colonialism)**

The European states are competing among themselves for the global resources and most of them are rising colonial powers.This competition and desperation to dominate made them innovate labour and cost saving machinery.

- **Scientific Revolution in Europe**

The rise in scientific temperament and a society more open to ideas formed a fertile ground for innovations and newer ideas.

- **Agricultural Revolution in Britain**

Under the enclosure movement the big landlords of Britain started taking away the lands of small farmers and peasants which created unemployment in the agri sector and this unemployed labour fulfilled the demands of the industrial sector.

- **Geographical discoveries and world trade**

With the beginning of geographical discoveries , new lands were introduced while the west had direct contact with the East which increased the demand of the products and this became the basic factor for industrial revolution.

- **Capitalism and capitalist class:**

The ideology of capitalism created a new capitalist class(investors) who invested heavily on capital goods.

- **Availability of coal and iron:**

Coal and iron reserves in England was also one of the causes for the Industrial revolution.
