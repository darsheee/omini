- The Preamble of the Indian Constitution is composed of four key components:
  - The source of authority of the Constitution, which is derived from the people of India.
  - The nature of the Indian State, which is sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, and republican.
  - The objectives of the Constitution, which include justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity.
  - The date of adoption of the Constitution.

- The Preamble includes several key terms:
:::details Sovereign
- Sovereign: India is an independent state with no authority above it. It can conduct its own affairs and can acquire or cede foreign territory.
  :::

:::details Socialist
- Socialist: The Constitution has a socialist content, aiming to establish a 'socialistic pattern of society'. This is a democratic socialism, not a communistic socialism, and involves a mixed economy with both public and private sectors.
  :::

:::details Secular
  - Secular: The Constitution guarantees the fundamental right to freedom of religion and supports all religions equally.
:::
:::details Democratic
  - Democratic: The Constitution provides for a representative parliamentary democracy, with the executive responsible to the legislature. It includes universal adult franchise, periodic elections, rule of law, independence of judiciary, and non-discrimination.
  :::

:::details Republic
  - Republic: The head of the state, the president, is elected indirectly for a fixed period of five years. There is no privileged class and all public offices are open to every citizen.
::: 

:::details Justice
  - Justice: The Constitution secures social, economic, and political justice through Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles. This includes equal treatment of all citizens, non-discrimination based on economic factors, and equal political rights.
:::
:::details Liberty
  - Liberty: The Constitution secures liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship for all citizens. This liberty is not absolute but qualified.
 :::
 :::details Equality
  - Equality: The Constitution secures equality of status and opportunity for all citizens, without any special privileges or discrimination.
 :::
 :::details Fraternity
- Fraternity: The Constitution promotes a sense of brotherhood through a system of single citizenship. It assures the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation.
 :::

- The Constitution also includes provisions to protect the dignity of individuals and to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India. It aims to overcome hindrances to national integration such as communalism, regionalism, casteism, linguism, and secessionism.

### Preamble constitutes part of the Constitution? 
- There was initially some controversy over whether the Preamble constitutes part of the Constitution.

- In Berubari Union case (1960), the Supreme Court said the Preamble shows the general purposes behind the Constitution and can aid in interpretation. However, it specifically stated the Preamble is not part of the Constitution.

- In Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) and LIC of India case (1995), the Supreme Court rejected this view and held that the Preamble is part of the Constitution. Like any other part, it was enacted by the Constituent Assembly, though after the rest of the Constitution. The Constituent Assembly also voted to include the Preamble as part of the Constitution.

- Two key points:
  - The Preamble is neither a source of power to the legislature nor a prohibition on the legislature's powers.
  - It is non-justiciable, meaning its provisions are not enforceable in courts of law.

- In Kesavananda Bharati case (1973), the Supreme Court held that the Preamble can be amended under Article 368, subject to not amending the basic features of the Constitution enshrined in the Preamble.

- The Preamble has been amended only once, in 1976, by the 42nd Amendment, which added the words 'Socialist', 'Secular' and 'Integrity'. This amendment was held valid.

- In summary, the current position is that the Preamble constitutes part of the Constitution and can be amended, but without altering the basic features of the Constitution contained within it. The Preamble lays down the objectives and philosophy behind the Constitution but is non-justiciable.
