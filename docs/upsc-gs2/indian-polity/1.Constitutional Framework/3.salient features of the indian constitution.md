## Salient Features of the Constitution

- The Constitution of India, while borrowing from various global constitutions, has unique features that distinguish it from others. Several original features have undergone substantial changes due to amendments, notably the 7th, 42nd, 44th, 73rd, 74th, 97th and 101st Amendments.
- The Constitution of India is the lengthiest written constitution in the world, originally containing a Preamble, 395 Articles and 8 Schedules. Currently, it consists of a Preamble, about 470 Articles and 12 Schedules. The size of the Constitution is attributed to geographical and historical factors, single Constitution for both the Centre and the states, and dominance of legal luminaries in the Constituent Assembly.
- The Constitution of India has borrowed most of its provisions from the Constitutions of various other countries as well as from the Government of India Act of 1935. The structural part of the Constitution is largely derived from the Government of India Act of 1935.
- The Constitution of India is neither rigid nor flexible, but a synthesis of both. Article 368 provides for two types of amendments: some provisions can be amended by a special majority of the Parliament, and some other provisions can be amended by a special majority of the Parliament and with the ratification by half of the total states.
- The Constitution of India establishes a federal system of Government with a strong Centre, single Constitution, single citizenship, flexibility of Constitution, integrated judiciary, appointment of state governor by the Centre, all-India services, emergency provisions and so on.
- The Constitution of India has opted for the British Parliamentary System of Government rather than American Presidential System of Government. The parliamentary system is based on the principle of co-operation and co-ordination between the legislative and executive organs.
- The Constitution establishes an integrated and independent judiciary with the Supreme Court at the top. The Supreme Court is a federal court, the highest court of appeal, the guarantor of the fundamental rights of the citizens and the guardian of the Constitution.
- The Constitution guarantees six fundamental rights to all the citizens: Right to Equality, Right to Freedom, Right against Exploitation, Right to Freedom of Religion, Cultural and Educational Rights, and Right to Constitutional Remedies. These rights are justiciable in nature, enforceable by the courts for their violation.
- The Directive Principles of State Policy is a ‘novel feature’ of the Indian Constitution. They are enumerated in Part IV of the Constitution and are meant for promoting the ideal of social and economic democracy. They seek to establish a ‘welfare state’ in India.
- The original constitution did not provide for the Fundamental Duties of the citizens. These were added during the operation of internal emergency (1975–77) by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1976 on the recommendation of the Swaran Singh Committee. The 86th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2002 added one more fundamental duty.

- Part IV-A of the Indian Constitution, Article 51-A, outlines eleven Fundamental Duties for citizens. These include respecting the Constitution, national flag, and national anthem, protecting the country's sovereignty, unity, and integrity, promoting brotherhood among all people, and preserving the country's rich cultural heritage. These duties, while non-justiciable, serve as a reminder to citizens of their responsibilities towards their country, society, and fellow citizens.

- The Indian Constitution establishes India as a Secular State, not favoring any particular religion. This secular character is reflected in various provisions, including the addition of the term 'secular' to the Preamble by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1976, the guarantee of liberty of belief, faith, and worship to all citizens, and the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of religion. The Constitution also ensures equal opportunity in public employment, freedom of conscience, and the right to manage religious affairs, among others.

- The Indian Constitution adopts the positive concept of secularism, giving equal respect to all religions. It has abolished the old system of communal representation, instead providing temporary reservation of seats for scheduled castes and tribes to ensure their adequate representation.

- The Constitution adopts universal adult franchise for elections to the Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies. Every citizen aged 18 or above has the right to vote without discrimination. The voting age was reduced from 21 to 18 years in 1989 by the 61st Constitutional Amendment Act.

- Despite being a federal Constitution, the Indian Constitution provides for only a single citizenship. All citizens enjoy the same political and civil rights across the country, with no discrimination based on their state of birth or residence.

- The Constitution establishes certain independent bodies, such as the Election Commission, Comptroller and Auditor-General of India, Union Public Service Commission, and State Public Service Commission. These bodies are designed to ensure the democratic functioning of the government.

- The Constitution contains elaborate emergency provisions to enable the President to effectively meet extraordinary situations. These provisions are designed to safeguard the country's sovereignty, unity, integrity, security, the democratic political system, and the Constitution itself.

- The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992 added a third-tier of Government, giving constitutional recognition to panchayats and municipalities.

- The 97th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2011 gave constitutional status and protection to co-operative societies, making the right to form such societies a fundamental right.

- Despite criticisms of being a borrowed Constitution, the framers of the Indian Constitution made necessary modifications to suit Indian conditions, avoiding faults of other constitutions. The Constitution is not a carbon copy of the 1935 Act, but borrows from it in areas mostly related to administration. The Constitution is not un-Indian or anti-Indian, but reflects the political traditions and spirit of India.
