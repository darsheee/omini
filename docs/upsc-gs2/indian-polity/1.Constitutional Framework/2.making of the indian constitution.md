The idea of a Constituent Assembly for India was first proposed by M.N. Roy in 1934. The Indian National Congress (INC) officially demanded a Constituent Assembly to frame the Constitution of India in 1935.

- The British Government accepted the demand for a Constituent Assembly in principle in the ‘August Offer’ of 1940.
- The Constituent Assembly was constituted in November 1946 under the scheme formulated by the Cabinet Mission Plan. The total strength of the Constituent Assembly was to be 389, with 296 seats allotted to British India and 93 seats to the princely states.
- The Constituent Assembly held its first meeting on December 9, 1946. The Muslim League boycotted the meeting and insisted on a separate state of Pakistan.
- On December 13, 1946, Jawaharlal Nehru moved the historic ‘Objectives Resolution’ in the Assembly. It laid down the fundamentals and philosophy of the constitutional structure.
- The Indian Independence Act of 1947 made the Assembly a fully sovereign body, which could frame any Constitution it pleased. The act empowered the Assembly to abrogate or alter any law made by the British Parliament in relation to India.
- The Constituent Assembly also performed functions such as ratifying India’s membership of the Commonwealth, adopting the national flag, national anthem, and national song, and electing Dr. Rajendra Prasad as the first President of India.
- Dr. B.R. Ambedkar introduced the final draft of the Constitution in the Assembly on November 4, 1948. The motion on Draft Constitution was declared as passed on November 26, 1949, and received the signatures of the members and the president.
- Some provisions of the Constitution pertaining to citizenship, elections, provisional parliament, temporary and transitional provisions, and short title came into force on November 26, 1949. The remaining provisions of the Constitution came into force on January 26
- The critics argued that the Constituent Assembly was not a representative body as its members were not directly elected by the people of India on the basis of universal adult franchise.

- The critics maintained that the Constituent Assembly was not a sovereign body as it was created by the proposals of the British Government. Further, they said that the Assembly held its sessions with the permission of the British Government.  

- According to the critics, the Constituent Assembly took unduly long time to make the Constitution. They stated that the framers of the American Constitution took only four months to complete their work. In this context, Naziruddin Ahmed, a member of the Constituent Assembly, coined a new name for the Drafting Committee to show his contempt for it. He called it a “Drifting Committee”.

- The critics charged that the Constituent Assembly was dominated by the Congress party. Granville Austin, an American Constitutional expert, remarked: ‘The Constituent Assembly was a one-party body in an essentially one-party country. The Assembly was the Congress and the Congress was India’.  

- It is also maintained by the critics that the Constituent Assembly was dominated by lawyers and politicians. They pointed out that other sections of the society were not sufficiently represented. This, to them, is the main reason for the bulkiness and complicated language of the Constitution.  

- According to some critics, the Constituent Assembly was a Hindu dominated body. Lord Viscount Simon called it ‘a body of Hindus’. Similarly, Winston Churchill commented that the Constituent Assembly represented ‘only one major community in India’.

- Elephant was adopted as the symbol (seal) of the Constituent Assembly.

- The original Constitution contained 395 Articles and 8 Schedules.

- The Constitution was signed by 284 members on November 26, 1949.
